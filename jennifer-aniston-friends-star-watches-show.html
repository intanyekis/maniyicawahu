The legendary sitcom, which ran from 1994 to 2004 touched viewers all over the world as it hilariously followed the lives of six friends living in New York City, trying to find themselves in their 20s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show featured comedy that made your sides hurt, <a href=#>exciting celebrity cameos</a>, and plenty of heartfelt moments that made viewers feel like they were part of the Friends family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Reese Witherspoon "Was Too Scared" To Reprise Her Role On 'Friends'</a></span></p><p>Being part of a show like Friends was a life-changing experience for its six main stars. Although it came with disadvantages too, <a href=#>like invasions of privacy and other prices of fame that are hard to deal with</a>, the cast looks back fondly on their time making the show.</p><p>But do they watch it? It seems that most of the cast definitely don’t adore Friends the way the fans do, but one of the stars is as obsessed as the rest of the world. Read on to find out who!</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston-has-a-thing-for-the-reruns>Jennifer Aniston Has A Thing For The Reruns</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>You’d think that the stars of Friends would be so sick of the show’s content that they wouldn’t want to watch it at all. But as it turns out, Jennifer Aniston loves the show as a viewer, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even tunes in to reruns whenever they’re on</a>.</p><p>"I can't help it," she explained of her decision to watch old episodes of the show on The One Show (via Harper’s Bazaar). "First, I'm trying to remember which episode it is and half the time I'm saying to myself, 'I don't remember that.' You get sucked into the nostalgia of it."</p><h2 id=the-entire-cast-hated-the-39-friends-39-theme-song>The Entire Cast Hated The 'Friends' Theme Song</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jennifer Aniston appreciates watching Friends, there is one part of the show that she isn’t fond of. And, along with the rest of the cast, she never was fond of the iconic theme song.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why The 'Friends' Cast Took A Spontaneous Trip To Vegas Before The Pilot Aired</a></span></p><p>“No one was really a big fan of that theme song," she said admitted (via Harper’s Bazaar). "I'm sorry, I don't mean to say that. We felt it was a little, I dunno, dancing in a pond, a fountain felt sort of odd, but we did it. Because we were told to."</p><p>This is a tragic admission to fans of the show, for whom the lyrics “I’ll be there for you” are a source of comfort and nostalgia.</p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-has-not-even-seen-the-entire-series-of-lsquo-friends-rsquo>Lisa Kudrow Has Not Even Seen The Entire Series of ‘Friends’</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jennifer Aniston may be a fan of the show, but her former co-star Lisa Kudrow isn’t. In fact, according to the Hindustan Times, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kudrow has not even seen the entire series</a>.</p><p>The actress, who portrayed Phoebe Buffay, revealed that she did watch Season 4 with her husband Michel. But she didn’t go through with watching the rest of the series.</p><h2 id=lisa-kudrow-was-ldquo-mortified-rdquo-with-herself>Lisa Kudrow Was “Mortified” With Herself</h2><p>During the Friends reunion special which aired in 2021, Kudrow shed some light on why <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she didn’t want to continue watching the show after she saw the fourth season</a>. Although it’s hard for fans to believe, she felt “mortified” watching herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Did David Schwimmer Really Feel About Joey And Rachel Hooking Up?</a></span></p><p>“Michel and I started watching some of season 4, which I thought I had watched, it's as if I didn't," she said after playing a duet of ‘Smelly Cat’ with Lady Gaga. "He enjoys them more than I do because I'm mortified with myself."</p><h2 id=david-schwimmer-only-watched-the-series-with-his-daughter>David Schwimmer Only Watched The Series With His Daughter</h2><p>It seems that some of the Friends stars only watch the series when their loved ones want to watch it. Case in point: David Schwimmer.</p><p>During the reunion special, Schwimmer, who played Ross Geller, admitted that he hadn’t watched the show in 17 years. But he did end up tuning in after his daughter started watching it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Like Lisa, I hadn't seen it really in 17 years," the actor admitted. "Until my daughter just started watching it this past year and that kind of sucked me into it.”</p><h2 id=courteney-cox-binge-watched-the-show-in-quarantine>Courteney Cox Binge-Watched The Show In Quarantine</h2><p>Courteney Cox, who played Monica Geller on the show, does appear to be a bigger fan of Friends than some of her co-stars. She admitted that, like many people around the world, she binge-watched the show while in quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>“It’s really good!” she told talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel.</p><p>Cox went on to explain that while she believes the show is good now, she doesn’t remember the episodes from when she acted in them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I don’t even remember even being on the show. I have such a bad memory,” she said. "I remember loving obviously everybody there, and having fun, and I remember certain times in my life that I was there. But I don’t remember episodes. I would never pass. I fail every test."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Truth About Jennifer Aniston And David Schwimmer's Relationship</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyapaKrpKS7brLRopynnKNiwLWt0WaumqyTnbK0edKhprBn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./analicia-chaves-model-wiki-biography-age-height-weight-boyfriend-family-net-worth-career-facts.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Analicia Chaves (Model) Wiki, Biography, Age, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family, Net Worth, Career, ">&larr;
