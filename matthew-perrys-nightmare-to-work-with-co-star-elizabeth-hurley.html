Friends fans want to know a wide array of things like <a href=#>who is Lisa Kudrow's son</a>, <a href=#>how rich is Matt LeBlanc</a>, and <a href=#>if the cast got along</a>.</p><p>While Friends brought millions of fans a lot of joy, however, some facts about the show's cast are pretty sad to learn. One perfect example of that is the fact that one of <strong><a href=#>Matthew Perry's</a></strong> co-stars labeled him a "nightmare" to work with.</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-39-s-addiction-made-working-with-him-a-quot-nightmare-quot>Matthew Perry's Addiction Made Working With Him A "Nightmare"</h2><p>In 2002, a rom-com titled Serving Sara was released and became a flop. While it was unfortunate that the movie failed at the box office, it makes sense once you learn about what went on behind the scenes. After all, Serving Sara's star Elizabeth Hurley once admitted that it was a "nightmare" to work with her co-star in the film, Matthew Perry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/elizabeth-hurley-and-matthew-perry-from-serving-sara.jpg><p>In 2022, Matthew Perry released his memoir, "Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir". Unlike many Hollywood memoirs, Perry's book was very open about the mistakes he made in his life and how they affected the people around him.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How much money did Serving Sara make</a>, according to The Numbers?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>Production Budget:</p></td><td><p>$29,000,000</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Domestic Box Office:</p></td><td><p>$16,930,185</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>International Box Office:</p></td><td><p>$3,215,965</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the memoir's release, Perry's former co-star Elizabeth Hurley was asked about the book during a 2022 Yahoo! interview. While Hurley admitted that she'd only read excerpts of the book by that point, she praised the former Friends star's writing.</p><p>"I haven't actually read the book yet, but I've read [excerpts] of it. It's quite interesting. He's a very funny writer like he's a very funny man. He's an incredibly gifted comedian... his way with words is fantastic."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/friends-star-david-schwimmer-owes-his-acting-career-to-a-legendary-actor-that-nobody-would-guess.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Sir Ian McKellen May Be The Reason For Friends Star David Schwimmer's Entire Acting Career</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>When David Schwimmer found an unlikely and unknowing mentor in Sir Ian McKellen when he was just a little kid.</span><p>Partway through Perry's memoir, he wrote about the experience of making the movie Serving Sara. As Perry revealed, his substance use disorder resulted in Serving Sara's production being shut down so that he could attend rehab.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How long was Matthew Perry alive</a>, according to Britannica?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p>When was Matthew Perry born?:</p></td><td><p>August 19, 1969</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>When did Matthew Perry die?:</p></td><td><p>October 28, 2023</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>How old was Matthew Perry when he died?</p></td><td><p>54 years old</p></td></tr></tbody></table><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Perry was able to return to work, he had to revoice all the footage of him that had been filmed before his rehab stint. Needless to say, the delay and being forced to re-record a lot of dialogue had a huge effect on everyone else involved in Serving Sara's production.</p><p>In his book, Perry wrote with great empathy about how he affected everyone else who worked on Serving Sara. Perry also was blunt when he wrote about how understandably "pissed off" Hurley and Serving Sara's director Reginald Hudlin were with the situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/elizabeth-hurley-and-matthew-perry-behind-the-scenes-of-serving-sara.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During Hurley's aforementioned 2022 Yahoo! interview, she was asked to comment on what it was like to work with Perry on Serving Sara. To Hurley's credit, she went out of her way to talk about how much she liked Perry as a human being. However, Hurley was honest enough to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admit that Perry was a "nightmare" to work with</a>.</p><p>"I have very fond memories of him. To be honest, it was a nightmare working with him at that time and, as it's now known, our movie was shut down because of his addiction. We were in a force majeure and had to all sit at home twiddling our thumbs for some time."</p><p>Hurley then went on to explain that one of the hardest parts of working with Perry was seeing how much he was struggling. Hurley did this while also expressing that Perry was marvelous to be around when he was in the right frame of mind.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/lisa-kudrow-wasn-t-the-only-friends-actor-to-play-two-different-roles-during-the-show-s-run.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Lisa Kudrow Wasn't The Only Friends Actor To Play Two Different Roles During The Show's Run</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Every Friends fan knows that Lisa Kudrow played Phoebe and Ursula on the show but very few know about the other actors with two roles.</span><p>"It was tough, obviously he was having a tough time, but he was still very charming and a lovely person to work with, but you could see he was suffering for sure."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unsurprisingly, Hurley wasn't Perry's only co-star who expressed this kind of sentiment about Perry. Instead, several of his former Friends co-stars talked about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how difficult it was to watch Perry struggle</a> because they loved him so much.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/matthew-perry-revealed-the-one-strict-rule-the-cast-of-friends-never-dared-to-break.jpg><p>A perfect example of that is what Lisa Kudrow told The New York Times about how hard it was to watch Perry fight his demons.</p><p>Matt LeBlanc once told People about how he tried to talk to Perry about his issues but his co-star and friend wasn't responsive. “I tried to talk to him. There wasn’t a response. It’s such a personal struggle; they need to bottom out on their own.”</p><p>“Hard doesn’t even begin to describe it. When Matthew was sick, it was not fun. We were just hopelessly standing on the sidelines. We were hurting a lot. Matthew is one of the funniest people I’ve ever met in my life. He’s charming and hilarious. Most of our hard laughs came from Matthew.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elizabeth-hurley-paid-tribute-to-matthew-perry>Elizabeth Hurley Paid Tribute To Matthew Perry</h2><p>Roughly a year after Elizabeth Hurley admitted Matthew Perry was a "nightmare" to work with, he tragically passed away.

Most notably, Perry's main Friends co-stars released a joint statement after taking several days to try their best to come to some kind of terms with their loss.</p><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who are some of Matthew Perry's co-stars who quickly paid tribute to him</a> following his passing, according to Newsweek?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Morgan Fairchild</strong></li><li><strong>Wendell Pierce</strong></li><li><strong>Paget Brewster</strong></li><li><strong>Meredith Salenger</strong></li><li><strong>Kimberley Nixon</strong></li><li><strong>Jon Ronson</strong></li><li><strong>Mira Sorvino</strong></li><li><strong>Lucy Davis</strong></li><li><strong>Selma Blair</strong></li><li><strong>Yvette Nicole Brown</strong></li><li><strong>Lisa Ann Walter</strong></li><li><strong>Josh Charles</strong></li></ul><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there is no doubt that Perry will always be closely associated with his main Friends co-stars, they were far from the only ones who loved them.
