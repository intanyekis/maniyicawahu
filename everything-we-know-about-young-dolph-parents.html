Dolph distributed Thanksgiving turkeys while visiting Memphis to help an aunt who was battling cancer. Before this third shooting, the independent artist had survived two other ones.</strong></p><p><strong>Dolph admitted to being targeted when he was 17, 18, and 19 years old to The Guardian in 2018. Dolph was a product of the streets, where he worked as a drug salesman to help his struggling family. By sharing tales of survival in Memphis’s criminal underground, he increased his fan base.</strong></p><h2><span id=Where_was_Young_Dolph_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family>Where was Young Dolph born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family</span></h2><p>On <strong>July 27, 1985</strong>, Young Dolph was born in Chicago, Illinois. The family relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, when the boy was two years old.</p><p>Dolph’s parents, cocaine addicts who were unable to properly nurture the children, left him and his younger siblings in the care of their grandmother. Young Dolph claimed to see his parents every two to three weeks, according to Big Facts.</p><p>According to him, the majority of South Memphis’ children were raised by their grandparents because their parents were drug users. Dolph considered himself fortunate because he frequently saw his parents, whereas some kids didn’t get to see them very often.</p><p>Although it wasn’t fun to follow Grandma’s rules, Dolph credits them with making him a more responsible person.</p><p>Dolph remarked,</p><p><strong>“I thought she was the meanest motherfucker in the world.”</strong></p><h2><span id=Dolph_was_Raised_by_his_Grandmother_as_his_Parents_were_Cocaine_addicts>Dolph was Raised by his Grandmother, as his Parents were Cocaine addicts</span></h2><p>Dolph claimed he didn’t understand why Ida Mae, his grandmother, turned down the invitation to host several of his friends.</p><p>He admitted,</p><p><strong>“I didn’t get that shit at the time. But as he got older, he started to see why Ida was such a no-nonsense person.”</strong></p><p>Dolph continued,</p><p><strong>“She made a nigga ready for life.”</strong></p><p><strong>“My granny had a huge impact on me. She positively fouled up a nigga.”</strong></p><p>Dolph felt a growing need to provide more to the family as he grew older. He lacked the skills to obtain a regular career, so he started selling drugs on the streets. Young Dolph remarked to Vice:</p><p><strong>“Can you see a 77-year-old woman trying to raise three elementary school-aged children amid the neighborhood’s gang and drug problems? That is challenging for an elderly woman. I am now aware of all the responsibilities in my predicament. I couldn’t let her shoulder all the burden. I’ve always liked having money, so when I was 15 or 16, I dove into the streets.”</strong></p><h2><span id=Dolph_tried_to_get_his_Parents_clean_after_his_Grandmothers_passing>Dolph tried to get his Parents clean after his Grandmother’s passing</span></h2><p>Dolph was a little boy who may have had some hatred toward his parents, but he never expressed it. Because of their cocaine dependence, Dolph’s parents were unfit to nurture him and his brothers. The rapper’s song, In My System, discussed his parents’ drug problems. To Rolling Stone, he stated:</p><p><strong>“It’s my mother and father. Because my mother and father were cocaine users, I think that’s why I acquired the drug in my system. They were focusing on that. They were interested in that.”</strong></p><p>Early on, Dolph decided to assist his parents in controlling their addictions. According to Dolph,</p><p><strong>“I told my granny a long time ago that I was going to take my mom and dad out of the hood.”</strong></p><p>Dolph didn’t work hard to get his parents sober until after the deaths of his grandmother and aunt. He realized that he could use the time and energy he was putting into the streets for music and his parents’ recovery. He said to Vibe:</p><p><strong>“I only started making music after that. My granny then passed away. Following then, several more of my ancestors died of lung cancer. I simply realized that spending so much time on the streets was a waste of time. I might have been hanging out with my parents throughout that time. There are other ways to make money, but the streets are all we’ve ever known.</strong></p><h2><span id=Dolph_shared_Familial_relations_with_the_Late_rapper_Juice_Wrld>Dolph shared Familial relations with the Late rapper Juice Wrld</span></h2><p>On Thanksgiving <strong>2017</strong>, Juice Wrld’s cousin Young learned the news. Juice, unfortunately, passed away before they could bond.</p><p>He expressed his sadness at not spending time with Juice in a passionate Instagram post. He declared that he didn’t care about working with Juice; all he wanted was to get to know the adored late rapper and have a conversation with him. As Young put it:</p><p><strong>I was unable to offer my little Cuzzo all the game I intended to give him by placing him in the back of the RR. Juice and I were going to pull up to my grandmother in my Bentley with the top down, but I was unable to do so. I wasn’t even allowed to smoke any witch. Tell God to please make sure he saves me a seat while you watch over your moms and the rest of the family.</strong></p><p><span style=font-size:18pt>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Dennis Schroder Married, Gay, Parents, College</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Rapper</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Saykoji</a></h3>Scroll below and check our most recent updates about Saykoji's Estimated Net Worth, Age, Biography, Career, Height, Weight, Family, Wiki.
