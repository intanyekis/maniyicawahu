Wesley, their first child, was born in 2018, and Finley, their second, was born in 2020. In September 2022, rumors spread that Ned had cheated on Ariel with <a href=#>Alex Herring</a>, a producer for The Try Guys, a video company Ned started with three former BuzzFeed employees,<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Keith Habersberger</a>, Zach Kornfield, and Eugene Lee Yang.</p><p>The rumors started when a Reddit thread and a Twitter thread pointed out that Ned wasn’t in The Try Guys’ last three videos, intros, and podcasts. Ariel was also not on her podcast, You Can Sit With Us, which she hosts with her partners who are also members of The Try Guys.</p><p>Fans also thought there was trouble between Ned and The Try Guys because Ned and Alex were seen in an Instagram photo with The Try Guys promoting Keith’s “Eat the Menu” series at Caesar’s Palace’s buffet in Las Vegas. However, Ned didn’t make it into the final video.</p><p>A Reddit user said they saw Ned and Alex kissing in a club in New York City and posted what they said were messages from Alex’s fiance, Will Thayer, about the affair. This made the rumors spread even more. “So basically, I went to Niagara the Club last night and saw her kissing Ned from the Try Guys. I have videos if you need them,” the message to Will said. “She was wearing a red dress. I don’t know if that helps,” the message said next. The user also said that they talked to Ariel about it for an hour.</p><p>Fans also noticed that many of The Try Guys’ employees, like Keith, Zach, Eugene, and senior editor YB Chang, stopped following Alex and Ned on social media. Will also stopped following Alex on Instagram, deleted all of their photos together, and turned his account into a private one. Ned later said that the rumors about him cheating was true.</p><p>Now, let’s talk about Ned Fulmer’s wife. So, who is Ariel Fulmer, Ned Fulmer’s wife, and how did she feel when she found out that her husband and the father of her children were having an affair with one of his employees?

Wesley and Finley are Ned and Ariel’s two sons.</p><p>Ariel and Ned also had a parenting podcast called “Baby Steps.” The last episode came out in June 2021, but there hasn’t been a new one since then. “In this wacky parenting podcast that comes out every week, YouTube stars Ned and Ariel Fulmer talk about the dirty, messy truths of raising a happy family that looks good on Instagram.</p><p>The podcast’s description says, “Follow Ariel’s pregnancy journey week by week with a dash of not-so-expert advice, trending product reviews, and poop-in-your-big-boy-pants raw sincerity from a couple experiencing ‘the miracle of life in real-time.” Ariel and Ned also wrote a cookbook called The Date Night Cookbook in 2021. It has recipes for their favorite meals to eat on a date.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Ned Fulmer Meet His Wife?</h2><p>How did Ned Fulmer meet his wife, Ariel? Ariel revealed in a 2020 edition of her podcast “You Can With With Us” that she and Ned met at the birthday celebration of a mutual friend in December 2009, shortly after they had both moved to Chicago.</p><p>By April 2010, they were cohabiting. “We had just graduated from college. “Ned was taking comedy courses and was unemployed, but a buddy was going to get him a position with the Chicago tourism bureau,” Ariel explained.</p><p>Ariel claimed that she was 23 years old and worked as a registrar assistant at a private art conservation company at the time. At work, she met Rebecca, who had recently relocated to Chicago from New York with her boyfriend of eight years.</p><p>Rebecca asked Ariel to her birthday party but warned her that she did not have many girlfriends because the majority of her girlfriends were in New York and the majority of her Chicago friends were male. “I responded, ‘That is in no way a problem for me. I’m extremely single. I have numerous single buddies.’ I was looking forward to this gathering immensely.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Did Ned Fulmer’s Wife Feel When She Found Out He Was Cheating On Her?</h2><p>How did Ned Fulmer’s wife feel when she found out he was cheating on her?
