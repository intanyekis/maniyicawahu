However, their romance hasn't been convincing enough to shoot down the rumors about Zendaya's sexual orientation. And although it seems like <a href=#>Zendaya and Tom Holland are ready to take their romance to the next level</a>, the actress' sexuality has always been a topic of discussion. While being a supporter of the LGBTQ+ community, Zendaya has never admitted that she's bi or gay. But a recent interview may have just changed everything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in February 2021, the Euphoria star took part in a little quickfire Q&A with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>, and with just one answer caused fans' hearts everywhere to beat a little faster. When asked: "What is the quality you most like in a man?" Zendaya was quick to slightly change the question and make sure her answer was relevant to both men and women. The simple act of changing her response to refer to either gender sent people wild and had them questioning her true feelings more than ever before. Is Zendaya gay? Here are all the details...</p><h2 id=zendaya-advocates-for-lgbtq-representation-in-hollywood>Zendaya Advocates For LGBTQ+ Representation In Hollywood</h2><p>There have been various reasons for people questioning Zendaya's orientation as the star has openly supported the queer culture and actively promoted avoiding gender stereotypes. For example, she can rock a suit just as much as a dress. She also played Rue in Euphoria, which was a role that actively tackled gender identities and queerness. But she has been reluctant to open up about her own preferences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>A Look Inside Zendaya's Music Career</a></span></p><p>Recently, a viral tweet claimed that Zendaya was spotted in a gay bar. Fans were quickly shocked. Was this the proof they were looking for? The original tweet said, "'Zendaya spotted at a gay bar,' okay? Fork found in the kitchen, come on now."</p><p>This implied that it would be no surprise to see the actress in a gay bar, and fans were incredibly happy to find out this could be true. After all, with the character she portrays in Euphoria, most of her fans are from the LGBTQ+ community. So many people are waiting to find out what her orientation is. Later, it was revealed that the tweet was not true, but fans have not given up yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zendaya-corrected-a-gendered-question-about-her-relationships>Zendaya Corrected A Gendered Question About Her Relationships</h2><p>In her 35 questions interview, the actress answered questions on everything from what makes her happy to what has been her greatest achievement, and fans learned a lot about the star. For example, the living person she hates the most rhymes with "dump," as she said. The star also revealed that her biggest fear is disappointing the ones she cares about.</p><p>On the other hand, Zendaya used the show to highlight her stance on positivity, which she has actively tried to share with the world. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HITC</a>, she once said, "There is something to women owning their sexuality. And I think as long as it's done in a way where the woman is the focus, rather than male-gazing or sexualizing a female, it can be very empowering." But what did she say to set the internet on fire with her recent interview?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is What Zendaya And Taylor Swift's Relationship Looks Like Today</a></span></p><p>One of the questions was, "What is the quality you most like in a man?" Zendaya didn't like the wording of this question as she assumed it to be implying that she is straight. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Since the star promotes LGBTQ+ ideas, she quickly corrected the interviewer</a>, saying, "What do I most like in a person? How about that?" The actress continued to say, "It's such a big question, what is the quality I most like in someone? Kindness is probably not the best way to describe it, but some people are just good people, and you can just feel it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-zendaya-bisexual>Is Zendaya Bisexual?</h2><p>To Zendaya's surprise, the next question was, "What is the quality you most like in a woman?" she laughed it off and said, "Well, I guess that's the same answer." The star clearly sees no distinction between men and women regarding their qualities. For this reason, some fans think that she's pretty much acknowledging that she is open to dating both genders, and they were happy to see this. One user wrote, "when she said 'quality I most like in a PERSON,' how about that? My bi radar started BEEPING." Another one wrote, "Here for THAT question... Girl, I had to see it for myself." Finally, a fan pointed out, "well... we all know why the LGBTQ+ community is watching this."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Zendaya didn't explicitly say she is bi, it seems like the star doesn't want to be committed to a label. The actress has also admitted that young people should be free to experiment as they shouldn't commit so young. Meanwhile, <a href=#>other fans think Tom Holland is "the one" for Zendaya</a> and that she is straight.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>How Zendaya Completely Embarrassed Herself In Front Of Hugh Jackman</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dqbWmedmepZ2ZqZZ6qr%2BMoJiyZaKqurC%2BjJqara2Robm6edKtmKuslZl8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lori-lightfoot-chicago-mayor-net-worth-married-lesbian.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lori Lightfoot Chicago Mayor Married Life Lesbian Net Worth">&larr;
