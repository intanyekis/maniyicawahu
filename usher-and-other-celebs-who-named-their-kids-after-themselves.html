Over time, countless A-list stars found themselves facing backlash over some rather <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">unusual baby names</a>, including Gwyneth Paltrow's choice of Apple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Royal Fans Think Meghan Should Have Named Her Baby After Her Mom</a></span></p><p>Well, it appears as if Apple is as tame as it gets with names after Grimes and Elon Musk revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the name of their son</a> last year. Although we've come across some eye-brow-raising names, there are a few celebs who went a more traditional route and named their kids after themselves as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Usher</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Courteney Cox</a> did!</p><h2 id=usher><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Usher</span></h2><p>Usher recently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed his very first daughter</a>, Sovereign Bo Raymond, who is joining Naviyd and of course, Usher Raymond V. The 'Let It Burn' singer named his second boy after himself, keeping the family tradition alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering Usher is Usher Raymond the fourth, it was only fitting for the R&B singer to carry on the name after welcoming the now 13-year-old back in 2007 along with ex-wife, Tameka Foster.</p><h2 id=michael-jackson><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Michael Jackson</span></h2><p>Michael Jackson reigned as the King of Pop, and still does, however, his legacy now lives on within his three children, Paris, Prince, and Bigi. Although the youngest, who now wishes to go by Bigi, was known as "Blanket" for the great good of his childhood, the now 19-year-old made it clear in 2015 that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wasn't fond of the nickname.</a></p><p>Well, one thing many fans don't know is that Bigi birth name is also Prince Michael Jackson II. Similar to his older brother's name, the 'Billie Jean' singer, did, in fact, name two of his kids after himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=celine-dion><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Celine Dion</span></h2><p>In 2001, Celine Dion and her later husband, René Angélil, welcomed their first child together, none other than René-Charles Angélil.</p><p>The eldest of three was named after his father, who was Celine's esteemed hubby and manager. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angélil passed away back in 2016</a>, where his legacy continues to survive with René-Charles, who turned 2o earlier this year.</p><h2 id=future><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Future</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Future is known for his successful rap career, releasing hit tracks such as 'Mask Off', and 'Life Is Good', however, when it comes to his relationship with ex, Ciara, things weren't nearly as successful, to say the least.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Sweet Meaning Behind Bindi Irwin's Unique Baby Name</a></span></p><p>Despite their rocky ways, the duo <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed their son back in 2014,</a> whom they named Future Zahir Willburn, after the rapper. The duo's relationship came to an end that same year, and they now co-parent Future, who turned 7 this past May.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Johnny Depp</span></h2><p>Johnny Depp has lived quite the life under the spotlight, however, he's managed to keep his kids shielded from Hollywood as best as he could. After meeting Vanessa Paradis back in 1998, the duo hit it off, so much that they had not one, but two kids together!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lily Depp was born in 1999, and Jack Depp in 2002. While neither of those names appears to be the same as Johnny, it turns out that Depp's son, Jack, is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actually named</a> John Christopher Jack Depp.</p><h2 id=courteney-cox><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Courteney Cox</span></h2><p>Courteney Cox and David Arquette shared 14 wonderful years together before splitting up for good in 2013.&nbsp;Luckily for the two, they remained quite close, and are even more amicable today now that a significant amount of time has passed.</p><p>Although they always had a love for one another, the duo kept things civil at all times, mainly for their daughter, Coco. The 17-year-old was born back in 2004 and was named after the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first two letters of both of Courteney's names</a>, <strong>Co</strong>urteney <strong>Co</strong>x.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=snoop-dogg><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Snoop Dogg</span></h2><p>Snoop Dogg has certainly made a name for himself within the music industry, one that will continue to live on with not one, but two of his kids! Snoop, who was born&nbsp;Calvin Cordozar Broadus Jr, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">named two of his son after himself</a>, however, the 'Drop It Like It's Hot' rapper put a little twist on things.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>James Corden Gives Usher The Weirdest Baby Name Suggestions</a></span></p><p>Rather than going for the name as if, Snoop and his wife, Shante Broadus decided to opt for Cordell, and Corde, both inspired by Snoop's middle name, Cordozar.</p><h2 id=shaquille-o-neill><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Shaquille O'Neill</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shaquille O'Neal has certainly gone on to cement his name as one of the best to ever grace the NBA, ever! Well, with a name so great, it's only fair that Shaq let it live on with one of his kids.</p><p>While he is a father of six, Shaquille went ahead and named his youngest son after him, however, much like Snoop Dogg, the four-time NBA championship winner also put a twist on things. Rather than going for Shaq or Shaquille, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he and his ex-wife</a>, Shaunie O'Neal decided on Shaqir.</p><h2 id=jason-derulo><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Jason Derulo</span></h2><p>Jason Derulo saw a resurgence in his career when he managed to make it quite big on TikTok, and of course, landed one of the biggest songs of 2020 alongside BTS. Well, it appears as if things didn't stop there for Jason, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">welcomed his son</a>, Jason King Derulo, back in May of this year, along with his girlfriend, Jena Frumes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer revealed during an interview that the choice was an easy one to make, considering it's always been his intent on keeping the family name alive and well!</p><h2 id=will-amp-jada-pinkett-smith><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Will & Jada Pinkett Smith</span></h2><p>Jada Pinkett and Will Smith came close to naming both of their kids after them, however, they too decided to opt for a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bit of a creative twist.</a></p><p>Rather than Jada and Will, the duo went for Jayden and Willow! Considering the Smith family is full of talent, whether it be in music or acting, it seems as if their kids got more than just their names.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>Elon Musk and Grimes Just Made Their Baby’s Name Even More Complicated</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGisrKCVp3qiusNmpq2glad6pLHLnpmsZaedvG66wKacnWWknbKqvoykoJ2rXZaztbHRZquhnZ2osq3CxKxm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./britt-barbie-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography-429419-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Britt Barbie Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography">&larr;
