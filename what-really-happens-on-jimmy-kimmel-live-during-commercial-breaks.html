Fans completely lost it during his <a href=#>April Fools' prank alongside Jimmy Fallon</a>, as the two swapped shows during their episode. Fans had a blast watching the episode, but what was it like actually attending?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the following, we'll take a closer look at what it's like to attend the show. A fan detailed their experience, and listed some of the top moments of being in the audience. Among those reveals included what goes on during the commercial breaks. It appears as though the party continues during the breaks. We'll reveal what goes on, and how <strong><a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel</a></strong> reacts with the fans during breaks. We're also going to start by taking a closer look at the future of Jimmy Kimmel Live, and why the host decided to renew his deal for an extra three seasons, until 2025. It remains to be seen if the host signs a new deal, or if he calls it a day from the late night talk show scene.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel-extended-his-run-on-live-until-2025>Jimmy Kimmel Extended His Run On Live Until 2025</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jimmy-kimmel-live-emotional.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jimmy Kimmel Live released 21 seasons along with 3,588 episodes, and that number will only increase in the upcoming years. Given his longevity, Kimmel has contemplated retirement, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he ultimately decided to extend his deal on the show until 2025</a>, given that he wasn't ready to say goodbye.</p><p>"Being wanted is important, too. You know, ABC wanting me to stay. Which I didn't know. I was like, 'Oh maybe they want to start over. Maybe the people running the network now want to find a person of their own and put their imprint and have somebody for the next 20 years or who knows."</p><p>Kimmel continues, "Ultimately, it was just... I think I was having a hard time with the leaving part of it. And I don't mean just leaving. I mean what you need to go through, the emotional toll that that takes. Like, 'Okay, you got six months, now you gotta wrap it up.' And it was easier for me to go, 'You know what? I'll worry about that in three years."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Ted Cruz Thinks Jimmy Kimmel Purposely Cut To Commercial In Order To Save His Guest From Looking Bad</a></span></p><p>Fans of Kimmel were no doubt pleased to learn that the host was staying onboard for another three seasons. But one question fans typically have is about the experience of actually being at the show, and how it compares to watching it from home.</p><h2 id=during-commercial-breaks-an-audience-member-revealed-that-the-band-keeps-playing-while-the-audience-director-speaks-to-the-crowd>During Commercial Breaks An Audience Member Revealed That The Band Keeps Playing While The Audience Director Speaks To The Crowd</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jimmy-kimmel.jpg><p>So how different is Jimmy Kimmel Live in-house compared to what fans see on TV? Well, according to a fan alongside Study Break, the experience really isn't all that different. Chris Meng discussed his experience and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">among the differences included what goes on during the commercial breaks</a>. The fan revealed that ambiance is great throughout the show, and that includes when they cut to commercial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The live show isn’t much different from the YouTube clips. There were commercial breaks between each segment during which the band would play music and the audience director would speak to us."</p><p>The fan continues, "However, what made the experience was the audience’s energy, real and manufactured. I guess that’s what the California dream is all about. I feel lucky that I had the chance to experience it."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Interview With Joaquin Phoenix Took A Turn After The Host Showed Footage Phoenix Did Not Want To Share</a></span></p><p>Obtaining a ticket for the show wasn't easy either, but it was all worthwhile.</p><h2 id=jimmy-kimmel-also-interacts-with-audience-members-during-the-break>Jimmy Kimmel Also Interacts With Audience Members During The Break</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/jimmy-kimmel-crowd.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The audience member also praised Jimmy Kimmel for his excellent improv skills during the commercial breaks. Prior to Margot Robbie coming out for her interview, Kimmel chatted with the audience, and that included a couple that came all the way from Australia.</p><p>The fan wrote, "During the break before Margot Robbie’s appearance, Kimmel interacted with two audience members from Australia who were on their honeymoon. One of the pair was an analyst for the Australian government and somehow, as he always does, Kimmel managed to say something funny. It was impressive to see Kimmel’s talk show skills in use during an improvised conversation."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Nicolas Cage Hadn't Appeared On A Talk Show In 14 Years, But Returned To Jimmy Kimmel's Show For One Specific Reason</a></span></p><p>The fan would go on to reveal that he was encouraged to be enthusiastic throughout the show, given how in-demand the tickets were for the episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Before the show started, the audience director jokingly threatened to replace us with another studio audience if we weren’t loud enough, especially since this was the last taping of “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for the decade. Apparently, according to Dom, there were 50,000 requests for 200 spots — somehow, I was one of the lucky 0.4% to nab a ticket."</p><p>Without a doubt, it is an experience all fans won't forget, and they'll have until 2025 to get a chance to attend the show. It remains to be seen if Kimmel will extend after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BmrculsGagkaW9prrSZqanZZqeuq7FjKSgpqWVoXqttdWeZJ2top67qHnCqKSmnaKYtqK4jJupnpmbqHw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./harlow-darby-missing.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Harlow Darby Missing: A Frantic Search Ends">&larr;
