Have a look at her diet and workout (exercise routine).</strong></p><p>The excitement is growing for the cinematic event of the century, which will begin on the 21st of this month. On that day, <strong>Christopher Nolan</strong>'s Oppenheimer, a biopic about the father of the atomic bomb, and <strong>Greta Gerwig</strong>'s Barbie, a toy tie-in film starring <a href=#><strong>Margot Robbie</strong></a> as the iconic doll, are scheduled to be released.</p><p>Some interpret both of them as rivals, cheering on one or the other like spectators at a backstage snail race. These people are complete morons. Barbie and Oppenheimer are not rivals. They are two pieces of a larger book that seeks to depict the world during the second half of the twentieth century and America's role in it.</p><p>Apart from that, many people have observed that <a href=#><strong>actress</strong></a> Margot Robbie looks way too thinner in the trailer of Barbie. As a result, people wonder if she is sick or if she lost weight for the movie (her weight loss supposedly <a href=#><strong>altered her nose</strong></a> as well), Well, here's everything you need to know about her weight loss.</p><p>Check out the&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>weight loss</strong></a> stories of <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Bryant</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>MP Brandon Lewis</strong></a>.</p><h2>Margot Robbie Appears to Have Undergone Weight Loss for Her Role in Barbie!</h2><p>People have noticed <strong>Margot Robbie</strong>'s <a href=# rel=noopener>appearance</a> in Barbie. And they believe her weight loss is visible. However, the 33-year-old actress has not made any statement regarding her transformation.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/07/margot-robbie-after-weight-loss.jpg alt="Margot Robbie looks absolutely flawless in her weight loss appearance. houseandwhips.com" width=579 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 579px) 100vw, 579px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Margot Robbie looks absolutely flawless in her weight loss appearance.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Instagram (Fan Page)</strong></p><p>Even though she has not made any statements, we believe she lost weight for her role in Barbie. She is playing a Barbie after all. And her appearance in the trailer justifies why the filmmakers chose her for the lead role in the movie.</p><p>Actors frequently go through dramatic weight loss shifts in order to play particular characters effectively. They follow strict diets, exercise rigorously, and collaborate closely with nutritionists and trainers. These bodily changes demonstrate their commitment to their work and add to the sincerity of their performances. Likely, Margot Robbie appears to have worked hard to maintain her shape for the movie. Not to forget, she's competing with one of the most anticipated movies of the year.</p><p>She had gained significant weight in the last few years. However, it appears to have gone now. She has now achieved her original shape and there's no denying she is one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood when she is in proper shape.</p><p>Regardless, do remember that the given information is solely based on our speculation. We will definitely get back to you as soon as we get updates about her weight loss.</p><h2>Margot Robbieâ€™s Diet and Workout (Exercise Routine)!</h2><p><strong>Margot Robbie</strong>'s acting job frequently requires her to commit to a strict <a href=# rel=noopener>diet and workout</a> (exercise routine) in order to stay fit or cut down for a part. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Emirates Woman</a>, while Robbie avoids saturated fats, fast food, sugary beverages, and chocolate in preparation for parts, she always allows herself a glass or two of wine.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/houseandwhips.com/storage/2023/07/margot-robbie-diet-workout.jpg alt="Margot Robbie follows a strict diet and workout. houseandwhips.com" width=576 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 576px) 100vw, 576px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Margot Robbie follows a strict diet and workout.</strong><br><strong>Image Source: Instagram (Fan Page)</strong></p><p>Robbie's clean-eating, protein-rich diet, which includes porridge and a green smoothie for the morning, salad and lemon chicken for lunch, and fish (ideally tuna) with roasted veggies for supper, was also featured in the magazine. Robbie has also stated that she is not too hard on herself and gets miserable when she doesn't get to eat. She told,</p><p class=p1><strong><span class=s1>I'm not good at moderation. I get miserable if I don't eat. I can't just have a&nbsp;<span class=s2>salad</span>&nbsp;every day and half a glass of&nbsp;<span class=s2>wine</span> every second day. I can't do it...</span><span class=s1>I don't have a very good diet. I love beers, <span class=s2>fries</span>, burgers, but if I have to get in a bikini then I'll eat carrot sticks for three days. I'm one extreme or the other.&nbsp;<span class=s2>Chocolate</span>, waffles and fries are the main food groups that make up my diet.</span></strong></p><p>On the other hand, Robbie has played a variety of physically demanding roles during her stellar career. Aside from ice skating (of course), Robbie revealed to Australia's Body & Soul that her workout routine included weights, mostly, and lots of sit-ups. Robbie works out only five days a week, but each session is apparently four hours longâ€”her peak physical condition came as no surprise.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGikmqqXpMFuvs6bmaKdXayyqrPHrWSlp6OofA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./a-look-at-jay-zs-dating-history-all-of-rappers-girlfriends-ranked-by-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All Of Rapper's Girlfriends, Ranked By Net Worth">&larr;
