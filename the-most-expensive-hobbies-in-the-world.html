There are various kinds of hobbies that people get into, from the simple to the complex ones, and from the cheap to the expensive ones. Hobbies are either influenced by friends, co-workers or by the family they came from. People do hobbies to release stress, forget their problems for a while and to be distracted from other things. Hobbies that are expensive are done by the rich people, and when we say expensive, it will really sweep your wallets and drain your savings if you do not know how to fund it. Are you curious on what these expensive hobbies are? Here are the most expensive hobbies in the world today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ballroom-dancing><b>Ballroom Dancing</b></h2><p>It sounds like it’s not an expensive hobby, but in reality, it is considered one of the most expensive hobbies in the world. The dress itself will cost a few hundred dollars and may even reach up to $1,000 and above. If you are really into it, dance lessons will also cost you. In addition, travel expenses to dance competitions as well as board and lodging will all sum up to about $10,000 in a year.</p><h2 id=flying-aviation><b>Flying/Aviation</b></h2><p>Flying as a hobby will always be expensive. Many have dreamed of flying a plane on their own at least once in their lives. Well, bottom line is that if you have the money, only the sky is the limit. The first step towards achieving that dream is going to a flying school for training and having a pilot license. This can cost you more than $5,000. The prices of planes as well as the cost of keeping it in good condition is around $100,000. Renting a plane is a cheaper option as you’ll need to shell out only $80 per hour on the average. But if you sum it up, it’s still a lot of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scuba-diving><b>Scuba Diving</b></h2><p>The great wonders of the marine life are truly fascinating. With all the different coral reefs and various types of fish swimming into the deep blue sea, scuba diving can really be a great and addicting hobby. If you are serious about this, you should have enough funds to do it on a regular basis. Basic equipment cost is $500 minimum, and certification will cost you another $300-400. There are different types of corals and fishes per diving site, thus, typical scuba divers dream of going to different diving sites all over the world. This entails additional costs, from board and lodging, food, transportation, and other miscellaneous expenses. If you want to travel to the most famous sites like the Great Barrier Reef, you will need to save up at least $3,000.</p><h2 id=skydiving><b>Skydiving</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For those who are not familiar with skydiving, it is an action sport wherein you jump from an aircraft miles above sea level, then return to earth with the aid of gravity. You get to experience a certain amount of free-fall, then time yourself to open your parachute if you are near land. To land safely, you should know a variety of techniques on slowing down your fall, as well as controlling your parachute. Training is needed to do this variety of techniques, and it is expensive.</p><p>This extreme and expensive sport costs around $250 - $300 per single tandem jump, and an average of $1,500 for a package of 7-10 jumps. Each jump takes place very quickly, around 1-3 minutes only. Doing two jumps a week means shelling out an average of $2,000 per month, and $24,000 per year. If you do have the funds and you want an extreme hobby, this one is for you.</p><h2 id=drag-racing><b>Drag Racing</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you have an urge for speed and love to burn the rubber, you may want to consider drag racing. Here is a walkthrough on what the sport is all about. Each driver is allowed to perform a burnout to boost their start speed. Racers then line up from the start line and the release on the brakes are then determined on a signaling device called the Christmas tree. The Christmas tree is like a traffic light, but has different kinds of lights on it. The drivers should wait for the green light to be lit up before they launch. The first one to go past the finish line wins. Players should follow rules at all times, and a red light will be seen on the Christmas Tree if there are any violations.</p><p>In order for you to reach over 300 miles per hours, you should use a special kind of fuel, which is a combination of methanol and nitro-methane. The expenses you need to cover in getting your own vehicle, purchasing drag racing car parts and maintaining the vehicle itself can range from $200,000 – $1 million.</p><h2 id=collecting-cars><b>Collecting Cars</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This hobby is obviously for can-afford guys only. There are different of kinds of cars to collect and each collector typically caters to 1 or more types of these. There are muscle cars, vintage cars, luxury cars, sedans, 4x4 trucks, SUVS, convertibles, off-roaders, sports cars, and racing cars. Each type of car has different features and styles, and price range varies also. Most car collectors usually go for the unique and rare cars. The rarer they are, the more money you have to shell out.&nbsp;Just how expensive are they? A classic 1937 Bugatti Type 57S costs $4.4 million while a 1961 Ferrari California costs $10.8 million. Most car collectors love to show off their collection. <a title="Jay Leno Net Worth" href=#>Jay Leno</a>, <a title="Ralph Lauren Net Worth" href=#>Ralph Lauren</a>, and <a title="Jerry Seinfeld Net Worth" href=#>Jerry Seinfeld</a> are examples of car collectors who have the most expensive car collections in the world.</p><h2 id=art-collection><b>Art Collection</b></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considered the most expensive hobby in the world, art collecting always means serious business. Different types of art like statues, paintings, and sculptures are priced from thousands of dollars to millions. If you are considering acquiring the best “collection” of rare art, a million dollars will not be enough. Even a couple thousand dollars will not be enough if you are a starter and want real art, not reproductions. The artwork entitled “The Card Players” done by Paul Cezanne is considered the most expensive work of art ever sold, with a tag price of $250 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGaln6jBbrHXqZynq5mrsm60zpuZop2jYravedOhnGavn6e5pXs%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-marlena-campbell-marques-houstons-ex-wife-579357-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Marlena Campbell?
