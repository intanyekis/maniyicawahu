throughout the entire game.</p><p>Not only did Richmond achieve this incredible milestone, but his contributions to the Worcester Ruby Legs in their inaugural season from 1880 to 1882 are equally noteworthy.</p><p>Demonstrating his dedication, he took the mound for an astonishing 74 out of the team’s 85 games, accumulating an impressive total of 590 2/3 innings pitched.</p><h3># John Montgomery Ward</h3><p>In June 1880, John Montgomery Ward, at 20 years and 105 days old, pitched a perfect game for the Providence Grays, striking out all 27 Buffalo Bisons batters he
