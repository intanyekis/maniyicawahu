Despite constant break up rumors, the couple remained firm and strong on their relationship. She is currently pregnant with their second child, which she revealed during her Half-Time performance at the 2023 Super Bowl.</p><p>She may have found her other half, but there was a time when she looked up to Christina Aguilera and Jordan Bratman's relationship.</p><h2 id=rihanna-gushed-over-christina-aguilera-and-jordan-bratman-39-s-relationship>Rihanna Gushed Over Christina Aguilera and Jordan Bratman's Relationship</h2><p>Over a decade ago, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna admitted to Cosmopolitan that she's just as confused </a>as anyone else when it comes to love. She often goes to her male friends for advice when it comes to dating.</p><p>She said, "I have three girlfriends and about 20 guy friends. I love listening to guy talk because I learn a lot."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Rihanna Might Have Beef With The Kardashians For A Relatable Reason</a></span></p><p>At the time, the entertainment industry was head over heels for the couple Christina Aguilera and her <a href=#>ex-husband Jordan Bratman</a> since they seem to display relationship goals. Even Rihanna shared that she adored the couple since they have their own little world with their love for each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49176591.jpg><p>"It's tough because you want to be able to talk about it and be proud, but you have to be sure of that person first," Rihanna told Cosmopolitan. "Christina Aguilera and her husband [Jordan Bratman] are my favorite couple because they're in love and that's all that matters to them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-rihanna-39-s-favorite-couple>What Happened To Rihanna's Favorite Couple?</h2><p>Shortly after Rihanna's interview, Christina Aguilera and her husband filed for divorce. Less than two years after Rihanna gushed over the adorable couple, they have announced their split. Despite looking lovey-dovey on the press, the singer revealed they were miserable during their marriage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49176952.jpg><p>"You could definitely tell we were unhappy," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aguilera shared to </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>. "When you're unhappy in a marriage, your children are the ones who suffer. That's the last thing I wanted for my son."</p><p>Aguilera continued by saying, "I knew I had to end it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The <a href=#>couple who had Wonderland-Themed wedding </a>filed for divorce in October 2010, and it was revealed that it was filled with rough waters for a long time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened Between Pink And Christina Aguilera?</a></span></p><p>The Genie In The Bottle singer knew she had to end the marriage after realizing that it might affect her son. Although the couple tried to make it work for their kid, their marriage ultimately ended for their child's sake.</p><p>Aguilera opened up and said, "Things were so unhealthy and unhappy for both Jordan and me, I knew I had to end it. It wasn’t good for us, and it wasn’t good for Max to witness our arguments. Children can feel when things aren’t right in the home. I had bouts of extreme anxiety. I really didn’t want to hurt Jordan, and I felt torn about splitting our family up."</p><h2 id=what-went-wrong-with-christina-aguilera-and-jordan-bratman-39-s-marriage>What Went Wrong With Christina Aguilera And Jordan Bratman's Marriage</h2><p>One of the factor that might have contributed greatly to the marriage's demise was the fact that they were too young when they got together. Aguilera was only 21-years-old when she met Bratman, and not much older than that when they tied the knot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"At the time, it felt absolutely right," Aguilera said in the previously mentioned interview with People. "Jordan and I were best friends first, and then it grew to be more. He represented stability and love and safety-qualities I never got from a male figure growing up. I felt we could share the rest of our lives together. I wanted to marry someone who would be a good father. And he is."</p><p>The singer continued, "We were great the first year after Max was born. Jordan was amazing. He was the first to change Max’s diaper. Then things turned. I was nurturing Max and felt independent in that relationship. Then I went right into filming Burlesque [in fall 2009]. As a musician, you’re with your posse all the time, and during the movie I removed myself from mine. So I had an independence I’d never felt before. I was growing leaps and bounds daily. I went from being a girl to a woman."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/instar49192628.jpg><p>"We were both looking for different things. We just weren’t right for each other. I couldn’t face living another five years [together] and feeling that I wasted [that time] being unhappy."</p><p>Aguilera has since moved on to create a life with Matthew Rutler. They have one child together named Summer, and Aguilera works hard to have a peacefully blended family.</p><p>Rutler and Aguilera have been engaged since 2014, but the couple seems to have no plans to actually walk down the aisle. They are enjoying their lives exactly as they are and do not need to make their relationship legally official.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoqCRo7uiedaaqmavoqS7qHnAm6aurF2YtbO10q2gp5ldlrS2tcueqZplkaOxbrbOq5uapl2Xv6LAzJqlZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./sweeettails-age-how-old-is-she.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="SweeetTails Age: How Old Is She?">&larr;
