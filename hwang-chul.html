Chul’s life, however, was not always glamorous and prosperous.</p><p>He was frequently teased as a child because of his malnourished appearance. Ironically, it was because of this that he began his path of success in the weight room. Soon’s body was too lean when he was in his early twenties.</p><p>People hated him and treated him badly in the meantime. Initially, he did about 300 crunches a day for around 2-3 hours. Within three years, he noticed a difference in his body.</p><p>Born on the 1st of September 1983 Hwang Chul Soon is currently 39 years old. Soon is quite tall and his height measures 5 feet 10 inches while his weight is estimated to be between 93 and 102.1 kg.</p><p>As a bodybuilder, he has a masculine body figure with a measurement of 44-35-37. His biceps measures 16.5 inches and he wears number 11 in the shoe size. Hwang has black-colored eyes and the color of his hair is black as well.</p><p>After starting his journey as a personal trainer in one of the local gyms in Seoul, Hwang Chul Soon started to enter body-building championships. Hwang competed regularly and won many contests as well.</p><p>Chul Soon has earned most of his wealth from his work as a bodybuilder, fitness model, and trainer and lives a luxurious life. The total net worth estimated for Hwang Chul Soon is between $1 to $2 million US dollars as of now.</p><p>Hwang Chul Soon was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea. Chul has kept the details of his family a secret and has not shared anything about it. Hwang has also not revealed the details about his education but it is known that he completed his high school graduation from a local high school in Seoul.</p><table width=607><tbody readability=4><tr><td></td><td width=448></td></tr><tr><td>Nickname</td><td width=448>Hwang</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td width=448>Seoul, South Korea</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td width=448>September 1, 1983</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td width=448>40 Years</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Height</td><td width=448 readability=5>In Centimetres – 177 cm<p>In Feet and Inches – 5′ 10″</p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Weight</td><td width=448>In Kilograms – 93 to 102.1 Kg<br>In Pounds – 215 to 225 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td width=448>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td width=448>Black</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Profession</td><td width=448>Trainer, Fitness Model, and Bodybuilder</td></tr><tr><td>Sexual Orientation</td><td width=448>Straight</td></tr><tr><td>School</td><td width=448>High School in Seoul</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td width=448>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td width=448>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td width=448>Korean</td></tr><tr><td>Home Town</td><td width=448>Seoul, South Korea</td></tr><tr><td>Fathers Name</td><td width=448>Name Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Mothers Name</td><td width=448>Name Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Brothers</td><td width=448>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Sisters</td><td width=448>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Chul began working as a personal trainer in one of the gyms in Seoul, South Korea, after many years of weightlifting training. Later, in 2009, he brought his fitness career to the next level by entering bodybuilding competitions. Chul placed second in the lightweight division in his first game, the 2009 Musclemania World Championships.</p><p>He began competing regularly after that, gaining more size and strength each year until, by the end of 2010, he’d sculpted such an impressive physique that he earned the 2010 Musclemania World at Fitness America Weekend contest, winning his Pro Card as well.</p><p>Chul hasn’t slowed down since then, becoming a celebrity fitness trainer and appearing in a slew of Korean and American advertisements, TV shows, and magazines. Chul’s preparation and ability to lift weights began when he was 20 years old.</p><p>His motivation for embarking on this path was straightforward: he wanted to gain recognition from his peers and turn his “scrawny” body into something admirable. Chul used to do 3000 crunches a day, almost every day when he first began practicing. His workouts would often last more than two or three hours.</p><p>He later discovered, however, that this form of exercise wasn’t the most effective for building muscle, so he switched to a structured workout routine and focused on his diet. Chul’s physique started to improve dramatically after he modified his approach.</p><p>Soon has not shared much about his dating life or his marriage but it is known that the name of his wife is Yeona.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=2><tr><td>Girlfriend</td><td width=481>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td width=481>Married</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Wife</td><td width=481>Yeona<p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Riu1-300x238.jpg></p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Children</td><td width=481><strong>Son –</strong> Riu <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wikibio.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/download-9.jpg><p><strong>Daughter –</strong> Not Known</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Here we provide you the list of Hwang Chul Soon’s favorite things.</p><table width=576><tbody readability=6><tr><td>Favorite Actors</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Actress</td><td width=350>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Favorite Colour</td><td width=350>Black and White</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Favorite Holiday Destinations</td><td width=350>Germany, Italy, and London</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Favorite Food</td><td width=350>Chicken, Banana, Brown rice and Shakes</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Favorite Things To Do</td><td width=350>Clicking Selfies and Rigorous Exercising</td></tr></tbody></table><ul><li>The 37-year-old uses Instagram to share his images.</li></ul><ul><li>There are approximately 1.5 million Hwang Chul Soon fans in South Korea.</li></ul><ul><li>Hwang has shown that challenges cannot defeat your goal.</li></ul><ul><li>He did, however, appear in magazines and television shows.</li></ul><ul><li>Bodybuilding, he says, entails looking symmetrical.</li></ul><ul><li>Hwang’s physique is similar to that of Arnold Schwarzenegger, the popular bodybuilder.</li></ul><ul><li>He has massive arms, as well as wide calves and legs.</li></ul><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLXKopmip16qwHC01pqloGWTncKtew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jackson-lueders-wiki-age-height-girlfriend-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jackson Lueders- Wiki, Age, Height, Girlfriend, Net Worth">&larr;
