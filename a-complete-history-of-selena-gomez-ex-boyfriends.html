The former Disney star has had a number of high-profile relationships and <a href=#>been linked to many famous men</a> over the years. But you may be surprised to know all of the gentlemen she’s been involved with.</p><p>Many of Gomez's relationships have remained rumors, but some were confirmed after the fact. After dating men like <strong><a href=#>Justin Bieber</a></strong> and The Weeknd very publicly, Gomez may be attempting to keep her romantic life a little more private.

At the time, the two were both Disney stars. She even appeared as Nick’s on-screen love interest in the music video for “Burnin’ Up.”</p><p>In 2015, Selena addressed their time together, describing it as “puppy love.” “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was very sweet</a>,” the singer continued.

The romance was short-lived, but <a href=#>Charlie has been vocal about how damaging their time together was for him</a>.</p><p>In 2018, Charlie admitted their relationship was “short-lived” but very “impactful” and that it “messed me up.” “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I’m trying to put this the best way possible</a>: It wasn’t like I was the only person on her mind,” the singer explained. “And I think I knew that going in — what I was getting myself into.”</p><h2 id=the-weeknd><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Weeknd</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/selena-gomez-and-the-weeknd-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Only months after his break-up from Bella Hadid, The Weeknd began dating Selena in early 2017.
