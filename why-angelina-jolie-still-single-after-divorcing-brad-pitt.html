Hollywood fans thought the start of their relationship in 2005 would be forever, but news about their divorce broke the hearts of Brangelina fans. After their divorce, fans believe Brad Pitt is doing better than Angelina in love since the mother of six is still single in 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Mr. and Mrs. Smith' Turns 15: A Look Back At Brangelina's Iconic Film</a></span>Is Angelina Jolie single on purpose, or is she still hoping for Brangelina to come back? Did their divorce journey suck all relationship hopes for her to find another partner? Here's why Angeline Jolie is still single post-divorce with Brad Pitt...</p><h2 id=is-brad-pitt-single>Is Brad Pitt Single?</h2><p>Brad Pitt is a fine man who seems to be better as he ages. However, after his separation from Angelina Jolie, he struggled in getting back into the dating game after their 12-year relationship. An insider tells Us Weekly, "The trouble is that he hates the process and how he can't even step out for a friendly coffee without it being gossiped about."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite his dating slump, fans still linked him with different women—past and new—over the past few years. Jennifer Aniston, Brad's ex-wife, and Andra Day, Stevie Wonder's singing protégé, were involved in the rumors, but both denied allegations of their rumored relationship with Brad Pitt, supporting Brad Pitt's claim of his single status.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Brad Pitt Try To Look Like The Women He Dates?</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Recent rumors about Brad dating his Los Angeles neighbor, singer-songwriter Lykke Li </a>also surfaced on social media when fans kept on spotting the two in restaurants and private gatherings. But Lykke nor Brad have released any statement confirming or denying the growing speculations about their secret relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-angelina-jolie-still-single>Why Is Angelina Jolie Still Single?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Angelina Jolie admits she is single because of her high standards</a> in looking for a future partner. However, with the Lara Croft beauty and strength that she possesses, fans still find a way to speculate about a possible<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> relationship between Angelina Jolie and the Weeknd</a>. The two's candid pictures in an Italian restaurant talking for hours spread fast as both shared their passion for humanitarian projects for the betterment of children's lives, which could start a spark between the two.</p><p>But an insider was quick to dismiss the allegations by saying, "They aren't dating. He [the Weeknd] has enjoyed getting to know her and feels they have a formed a close bond". Her break-up with Brad Pitt caused a lot of harm to her and their children, which makes Angelina most upset.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Is The Richest Woman The Weeknd Has Dated, And Is She Richer Than He Is?</a></span></p><h2></h2><p>Whenever interviewers ask her about any plans in love, Angelina Jolie shortly replies that she is now diverting all her attention into taking care of their six children and doing humanitarian work rather than finding romantic love for herself.</p><h2 id=are-angelina-jolie-and-brad-pitt-reconciling>Are Angelina Jolie And Brad Pitt Reconciling?</h2><p><a href=#>The two did not end on good terms after Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie's public break-up</a>. However, if co-parenting and rebuilding their friendship will be better for their kids, they can reconcile. Both want to "move forward" with their individual lives for the sake of their children, but it seems unlikely they do it for any other reason.</p><p>After their public split, Angelina Jolie tells The Guardian, "I just want my family to heal. And I want everyone to move forward – all of us, including their dad. I want us to heal and be peaceful. We'll always be a family." After an eventful divorce process full of declarations of conflicts between the two, fans believe they are in the works of slowly finding a middle ground for the kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A reason for this could also be Shiloh's plead to her parents to settle their relationship battles and "move on peacefully." As the former couple's first biological child, sources say she is torn between her parents' divorce even after it ended. Although Angelina Jolie nor Brad Pitt want the media to involve their children in any public disputes, fans still try to get statements from the kids but fail to do so. Even during the divorce process, Brangelina would try to protect the kids from speaking to the media without their supervision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-is-brad-pitt-suing-angelina-jolie>Why Is Brad Pitt Suing Angelina Jolie?</h2><p><a href=#>Brad Pitt and Angelina own a French estate named Château Mirava</a>l, where they got married. After their separation, Angelina allegedly sold her share of the property without Brad Pitt's consent which upset the Fight Club star. This decision upset Brad because of its sentimental value and uninformed sale to a Russian oligarch.</p><p>In Brad Pitt's lawsuit, he says Angelina's action caused "gratuitous harm" to him. But Angelina responds by saying that selling her vineyard share was a "painful decision, with a heavy heart." Only when fans thought Brangelina was finally starting to mend their broken relationship with their children the new legal conflict shows it is still slow progress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Angelina Jolie getting sued by her ex-husband also gives another reason for the Hollywood actress to focus on her children's healing despite the feud with her divorcee. As shown in their ongoing lawsuit, the formerly golden couple's lack of communication somehow proves that being single would be the best thing for their kids right now.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Is Vivienne Jolie-Pitt Close With Her Lookalike Sister Shiloh?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdlruoscuipZplmqS5qrGMrKuipJxiwKq6xqWcZpmWqbKzecOiraiqk567qHnBq5idZaCewbV7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./revealing-the-face-of-the-terrible-nebula-who-is-it-real-name-age-and-wikipedia-bio.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is It?
