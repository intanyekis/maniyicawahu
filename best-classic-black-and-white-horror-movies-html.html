The stark contrasts between the black-and-white colors are jarring to the eye, and add a layered intensity to the psychological delusions experienced by the audience. Perceptions of the world around are mangled by the visual stimuli, resulting in a horrific film that successfully captured the fear and mistrust of the isolated post–World War I culture that created it.</p>Stream on Shudder <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Shudder</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7iy1800123a626wdwynhv@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror (1922)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mr00223h62kyple77p@published data-word-count=109>Released at the height of German expressionist cinema, Nosferatu was an unauthorized adaptation of Bram Stoker’s Dracula, and was almost lost forever after Stoker’s heirs sued over the adaptation and a court ruling ordered that all copies of the film be destroyed. Fortunately, a few copies of the film survived. Director F.W. Murnau was an innovator, combining built sets with real locations and adding a new layer of realism to the vampire tale, as well as trick photography to present Count Orlok as truly otherworldly. It’s an infamous work of art, and its messages about political unrest and illness epidemics serve as the beginning of horror as social commentary.</p>Stream on Pluto TV and Tubi <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Pluto TV</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Tubi</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7k5c7000z3a62aa2kojt4@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Man Who Laughs (1928)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3ms00233h62s6cannqr@published data-word-count=95>By definition, Paul Leni’s The Man Who Laughs is not a horror movie, but a romantic drama not unlike The Hunchback of Notre Dame. Still, as a major influence on the later Universal Monster movies and the inspiration for the DC Comics’ illustrations of the Joker in the Batman comics, The Man Who Laughs’ legacy far surpasses its initial introduction as a German romance film. Largely due the startling features of the titular character (not to mention the looming gloom that surrounds him), the film’s imagery leaves the viewers with a deep level of dread.</p>Stream on FilmBox <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Filmbox (via Prime Video)</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7khzx001h3a622ahe70dv@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Universal Classic Monsters (1931–1954)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3ms00243h62pjsqro3d@published data-word-count=109>Among the most iconic of all black-and-white horror films, the talkies of <a href=#>Universal Monster Movies</a> (Frankenstein, Dracula, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, The Invisible Man, Creature From the Black Lagoon, and Bride of Frankenstein) all established the building blocks for what would shape the modern horror film. Creatures were used as a vehicle to tell stories about xenophobia, sexuality, challenging God, questioning one’s identity, the inherent violence of mankind, and the fear of the unknown. Even in monochromatic tones, the Universal Classic Monsters painted worlds of horror, eliciting horror through trailblazing cinematic techniques rather than relying on the splatter or gore that would define the genre in later years.</p>Stream on Peacock <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Peacock</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7mjzu002y3a62hkzl3nbu@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Freaks (1932)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mt00253h62s6zk95yi@published data-word-count=97>Banned in Britain until the 1950s and easily one of the genre’s most controversial and ethically questionable films, Tod Browning’s Freaks serves as an examination of the monstrous extremes of human nature, forcing audiences to question their preconceived perceptions of those that appear different than the “norm.” Browning was fresh off of the success of Dracula when he made Freaks. The final moment of the film remains one of the most shocking endings in pre-code horror history, and takes a stance now common in horror: that sometimes the worst monsters are those that walk among us, undetected.</p>Rent on Apple TV and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Apple TV</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7pinx00463a62sfk1h626@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Murders in the Zoo (1933)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mt00263h62gdcyduc0@published data-word-count=138>As one of the first examples of an “animals run amok” horror film, Murders in the Zoo was extremely graphic for its time, and remains to be a rather distressing film by even today’s standards, due in large part to the footage showing the depressing state of zoos in the 1930s. Animals are crying out for food and kept in iron-clad cages, and at one point, they legitimately fight one another. In the film, a maniacal zoologist grows increasingly jealous of his unfaithful wife and decides to utilize live animals as a weapon to achieve “the perfect murder.” Barely over an hour long, the film unsuccessfully tries to marry horror and comedy together, but does provide one of the most jarring opening sequences of a film from this era using a man’s mouth, a needle, and some thread.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7q9cl004u3a62mgll86c4@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Cat People (1942)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mv00273h625ts1jqsr@published data-word-count=91>One of the first true low-budget horror success stories was also the saving grace of the financially failing RKO Studios. Perhaps the film’s greatest contribution is the iconic “bus scene,” a moment filled with such intensity that it serves as the premiere example of what would later become known as “jump scares.” It continues to serve as one of the most effective scares in horror history. Billed with a no-name cast and serving as the start of horror-producer extraordinaire Val Lewton’s career, Cat People was a revolutionary landmark in horror cinema.</p>Stream on HBO Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>HBO Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7r0ko005k3a621te9yzgw@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Seventh Victim (1943)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mv00283h62ho0m6sp1@published data-word-count=93>Satanism and lesbianism go hand in hand in another Val Lewton–produced masterpiece. Part noir, part horror film, The Seventh Victim is one of the first movies to treat women in horror as fully fledged people with their own thoughts and desires, allowing them full agency. The women are strong-willed, mouthy, and uncharacteristically bold in this pulp staple. Ultimately, it’s suggested that the power of these women comes from their participating in a Satanic cult, but since the film renders male participation to be all but useless, it deserves a rewatch by contemporary eyes.</p>Rent on Apple TV and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Apple TV</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7rhjk006c3a62ga1sw031@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Uninvited (1944)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mv00293h626h1rr8g2@published data-word-count=98>What is perhaps one of the first haunted-house films to treat ghosts as legitimate threats and sources of horror, the British-made flick has largely gone unnoticed by American audiences. That’s a crime: It’s one of the titles that Guillermo del Toro cites as having a major impact on his own filmography. The Uninvited boasts high-caliber acting performances and, crucially, practical in-camera ghost effects that rely on lighting, sound, and wind machines. It’s moody, it’s creepy, and while it may not deliver the scares today like it did then, a rewatch showcases an influence that can still be felt.</p><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7rxwl00763a62ifsemkmo@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Dead of Night (1945)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mx002a3h62ril0zizn@published data-word-count=84>Before horror anthologies became a subgenre of its own, there was Ealing Studios’ Dead of Night. Connecting five different stories from British filmmakers and a wrap-around, the film is a psychological creepfest and delivers what is arguably the best work of director Charles Crichton. In the film’s climactic ending, we’re introduced to a story involving a ventriloquist dummy that set the stage for just about every inanimate-object-that’s-actually-alive film moving forward. Even today, the cold, dead eyes of the sinister dummy serve as nightmare fuel.</p>Stream with Fandor <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Fandor</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7sbtm00823a62ggyh0w3u@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The Picture of Dorian Gray (1945)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mx002b3h62ml7n4t15@published data-word-count=104>I’m possibly cheating to include this film on the list, but The Picture of Dorian Gray is one of the first to showcase black-and-white as an aesthetic choice rather than a filmmaking necessity; four-color inserts of three-strip Technicolor were used for Dorian’s portrait, utilized as a special effect in a black-and-white world. Having that isolated moment of Technicolor heightens the horror of seeing Dorian’s painting age while he himself remains youthful. The film is a triumph in deep-focus cinematography, and earned Angela Lansbury her second Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress (not to mention her first Golden Globe win in the same category).</p>Rent on Apple TV and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Apple TV</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7t1fz00903a627i8z99ux@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mx002c3h62ac5f0p2q@published data-word-count=86>As interest and popularity in horror movies began to wane, studios struggled to breathe new life into what had been one of their most profitable sectors. Enter the horror-comedy. While plenty of old movies attempted to add levity to horror, Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein set the standard for horror-comedies and left an impact that’s still emulated decades later. By adding Bud Abbott and Lou Costello to pal around with established monsters like Lon Chaney Jr. and Bela Lugosi, Universal struck gold and spawned a franchise.</p>Rent on Apple TV and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Apple TV</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7tl8a00a03a62moa0l6vu@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Them!

Borrowing elements of horror as well as influence from the Japanese kaiju flicks, Them! is one of the earliest examples of genre fusion under the horror umbrella. The film avoids the tropes that would become popularized in later B-movie cinema, opting instead to treat the gigantic ant monsters as legitimate threats and presenting the horror as sincere.</p>Rent on Apple TV and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Apple TV</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7tzcd00b23a62u5kt7gzz@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Night of the Hunter (1955)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3my002e3h62x0tkbgd0@published data-word-count=93>The unfortunate truth of Charles Laughton’s The Night of the Hunter is that this is easily one of the best horror thrillers ever made, and easily one of the most forgotten. It’s the sole directorial effort of Laughton and stars Robert Mitchum, a prominent anti-hero of the noir movement who often played second banana. However, The Night of the Hunter is compelling, visually stimulating, and downright thrilling. It’s a film that feels so far ahead of its time that it would play better for today’s audiences than it surely did during the mid-50s.</p>Rent on Apple TV and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Apple TV</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7vxdi00c63a62bzvoqv7j@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mz002f3h626zsldnbw@published data-word-count=84>Although not the best rendition of the Body Snatchers story, the original 1956 incarnation is one of the best examples of a sci-fi–horror film rooted in reality, preying on the human fear that we are far more vulnerable to destruction than we’d like to believe. Released at the peak of Cold War and Red Scare paranoia, the political roots of Body Snatchers were far less ambiguous than the films that came before it, and the film successfully solidified the relationship between politics and horror.</p>Stream on Paramount+ <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Paramount+</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7weqz00dc3a62v1zg295y@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>The House on Haunted Hill (1959)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3mz002g3h62vhep4wte@published data-word-count=115>William Castle’s magnum opus, The House on Haunted Hill is one of the greatest haunted-house movies of all time. An eccentric millionaire played with perfection by Vincent Price offers $10,000 to anyone who can spend a night in the titular mansion, the site of a plethora of murders. The participants are faced by a ceiling dripping blood, a severed head, a vat of acid in the cellar, and the iconic skeletal apparitions that walk on their own. While a fantastic movie in its own right, The House on Haunted Hill’s more prominent legacy is rooted in Castle deciding to gear his horror films to a teenage market, a trend that horror films followed moving forward.</p>Stream on Pluto TV and Tubi <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Pluto TV</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Tubi</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7wr3r00ek3a62nbsn8xuy@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Eyes Without a Face (1960)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3n0002h3h62ybd65bts@published data-word-count=86>Georges Franju’s ghastly yet dreamlike examination of the quest for physical perfection, the social value placed on women’s appearances, and guilt. Once a respected surgeon, Dr. Genessier now lives in isolation, experimenting on animals and helpless women lured to him by his faithful nurse and lover Louise. The film is startlingly graphic and drips with art-house elements that greatly influenced filmmakers that followed.

With sex appeal, Bava builds a horrific landscape enhanced with slick camera work and intense black-and-white contrasts. The film plays around with both vampire and witch mythology, which eventually leads to a spiked mask being hammered into a woman’s face.

But it bears repeating: Alfred Hitchcock’s Psycho was a true game-changer in horror cinema. The sight and sound of Marion Crane meeting her demise is synonymous with what one imagines when hearing the words “horror movie.” Psycho gave roots to the slasher films that were to come, not to mention completely disrupted the idyllic world of the 1950s.

It’s also one of the earliest and best examples of the “creepy children” subgenre. The plot is on the heavy side: The Innocents plays with the mental anguish of a person desperately trying to make sense of the world around them while simultaneously dealing with their own emotional turmoil. The film’s iconic ending scored an X-certificate upon the first release, and theorists continue to this day to analyze the subtext of sexual repression, ghastly possession, and how the two intertwine.</p>Stream with ScreenPix <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>ScreenPix (via Prime Video)</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq7yn6u00k03a62y0dyxjoi@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Carnival of Souls (1962)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3n2002l3h62gfl16jil@published data-word-count=98>Hailed by many as an independent masterpiece, Carnival of Souls plays more like an extended version of an <a href=#>episode of The Twilight Zone</a> than it does a true-blue horror film. A low-budget endeavour with art-house sensibilities, the film’s fear factor is rooted in its odd visual imagery and dramatic light play. Director Herk Harvery also plays the horrifying apparition that haunts the leading lady’s imagination, a manifestation of her repressed fears as a malevolent force that she cannot escape, try as she might. Carnival of Souls is dark, atmospheric, experimental and a disturbing look into full-blown mental break.</p>Stream on Prime Video and HBO Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>HBO Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq83go700li3a62uy4kcba1@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Dementia 13 (1963)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3n3002m3h628r2nm3ow@published data-word-count=91>B-movie master Roger Corman produced this Psycho knockoff, which is also the non-pornographic feature debut of director Francis Ford Coppola. With a noticeably rushed script that nonetheless provided moments of legitimate shock, Dementia 13 was almost universally panned by critics and audience members alike. However, the movie is an extremely important addition to the black-and-white horror canon if for nothing else its unashamed aping of Hitchcock’s masterpiece. From this moment forward, horror began to unapologetically borrow from films that came before — an early sign of the remake culture to come.</p>Stream on Paramount+ and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Paramount+</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq83v7800n23a6274bzh55r@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Strait-Jacket (1964)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3n4002n3h62i54g57i4@published data-word-count=72>While Whatever Happened to Baby Jane? launched the “hagsploitation” subgenre, it was Joan Crawford’s starring role in William Castle’s Strait-Jacket that perfected it. Some critics viewed the film as one of the worst ever made, but Castle’s theatrical gimmicks developed the film into an audience favorite, and Crawford’s turn as a psycho-biddy set the bar for so-called “washed up” actors retreating to horror films once their Oscar-bait roles had run their course.</p>Rent on Apple TV and Prime Video <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Apple TV</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq84bo300oo3a62qwux7rov@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Repulsion (1965)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3n5002o3h62kxjfdroy@published data-word-count=69>Despite being over 50 years old, Roman Polanski’s Repulsion remains one of the most disturbing films ever crafted.

Every minute of this film is drenched in ominous dread, frequently crossing into the supernatural.

Romero is king of the zombies and the father of contemporary horror cinema, full stop. This low-budget, independent film from Pittsburgh completely revolutionized the horror genre and created a monster that has reigned supreme for the last 50 years. Before Romero, horror films were often set in faraway lands of isolation, but he brought horror to the suburbs, where families were only a monster outbreak away from meeting their demise. While he claimed until death that the casting of Duane Jones, an African-American as the lead role, was purely based on his acting talent, Romero’s decision to present a black protagonist is still one of the most radical moves in horror history.</p>Stream on Prime Video and HBO Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>Prime Video</a> <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>HBO Max</a><h2 class=clay-subheader_fancy data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-subheader/instances/cjnq8cmzp00vi3a626kasks4a@published><span class=fancy-divider></span> <span class=text>Eraserhead (1977)</span></h2><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cjnq6e3n7002r3h62vn4415a2@published data-word-count=71>The debut of auteur David Lynch, Eraserhead is a surrealist and tantalizing slice of cinematic horror that combines excessive gore, eroticsm, brilliant black-and-white cinematography, melodramatic performances, excessively dark humor, and a healthy dose of gore.

A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is as beautiful as it is peculiar, and as fascinating as it is haunting. Her strength is in creating atmosphere, a change of pace for a monster genre that frequently thrives on high-octane thrills.

The black-and-white cinematography only adds to its otherworldly aesthetic. The Eyes of My Mother is presented as an art film, but don’t be fooled: It’s a truly grotesque and emotionally jarring slice of cinema.</p>Stream on HBO Max <a href=# data-track-type=product-link class=cta-link data-track-variant=streaming>HBO Max</a><h2 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h2><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/ckgjokogm0000ngogkes0ju0d@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Every Classic Universal Monster Movie, Ranked</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cj9743ah900asmjye3dbljm4u@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>The 21 Best Witch Movies of All Time</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>30 Great Black-and-White Horror Movies Worth Revisiting</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnyjsdKtZJykkajAqq%2BMm6Oam5tirq%2BwjLCfoqyVYrWwvtGoqWaln6u2pr%2BNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./all-about-charlie-hill-grant-brother-of-lana-del-rey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About Charlie Hill Grant, Brother Of Lana Del Rey">&larr;
