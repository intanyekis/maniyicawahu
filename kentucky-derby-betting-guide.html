Here’s your handy beginner’s guide on betting on one of the biggest sporting events of the year. The Kentucky Derby starts just before 7 p.m. on Saturday and you’ll want a place a bet to add some excitement. The good news is that for as little as $2, you can bet on the winner of the race.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The Kentucky Derby might feel like an intimidating event to start becoming a racing expert, but it’s actually one of the best days a beginner can join. The Derby draws fans from all ranges of experience. Some might bet on a horse simply because they like the color, and others might pick one with their favorite name.</p><p>There’s good value to be had due to many horses in the race, combined with the sheer volume of money in the betting pools. A $2 bet on Country House in 2019 (who moved up via disqualification in one of the more shocking runnings of the Kentucky Derby) would’ve netted the winner $132.40. Not a bad investment.</p><p>Here are some basic things to know about betting on the “Most exciting two minutes in sports.” Look out for more in-depth betting strategies for the Kentucky Derby later this week.</p><p><strong>Where can I bet?</strong></p><p>It’s possible to bet from the comfort of your house instead of going to a sportsbook or off-track betting parlor. Twinspires, which is Churchill Downs’ official betting app, is a great option for getting in on the action. Horse betting is regulated differently than sports betting and it is available in a lot more states than sportsbooks.</p><p>It’s a safe, easy, free way to bet, but if you plan to utilize Twinspires, sign up well in advance to avoid any headaches on Derby Day.</p><p><strong>What should I know about the Kentucky Derby itself?</strong></p><p>The Kentucky Derby is run at 1 1/4 miles for 3-year-olds only. It’s the first leg of the Triple Crown, which consists of three races, spaced a total of five weeks apart at three different tracks. The Derby is run first, followed by the Preakness at Pimlico two weeks later, concluding with the 1 1/2 mile Belmont Stakes at Belmont Park.</p><p>Up to <a href=#>20 horses</a> are allowed into the starting gate based on points earned from races dating back to their 2-year-old season. It’s the longest race any of these horses have run, up to this point in their careers, and it’s also the most crowded, as most of the major North American races are capped at 14 starters. That essentially means anything can happen on the first Saturday in May.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>The crowded nature of the race means post position matters. Any horse that draws the first or second post (the stalls closest to the inside rail) is almost an automatic toss (a horse with no chance of winning). Horses from those positions haven’t won a Derby since 1986. That’s because they usually get caught in a traffic jam with every horse trying to get position on the rail early on in the race. A good example of this is when the favored Lookin at Lucky placed sixth due to traffic issues in 2010.</p><p>However, Churchill Downs recently debuted a new 20-stall starting gate vs. the old setup, where they had to use an auxiliary gate for the Derby. That could make the rail less detrimental than usual, although it’s still something to consider.</p><p><strong>What else should I know?</strong></p><p>The fun doesn’t just start on Saturday. Get involved in the betting on Friday to get your feet wet on Kentucky Oaks Day. There’s a ton of great racing all day Friday on the undercard, concluding with the Kentucky Oaks at 5:51 p.m. E.T. on Friday. Some of the best horses in the country of all ages are racing on these two days, and the fields are smaller and less intimidating. Plus, there are often bets that involve both a race on Friday and Saturday.</p><h3><strong>What are the types of bets?</strong></h3><h3><strong>Basic Bets</strong></h3><p><strong>Win, Place, Show</strong></p><p>For a minimum of $2, a bet can be placed on a single horse to either win, place (come in first or second), or show (come in first, second or third). If you think the favorite could be beaten, betting a longshot horse “across the board” is a good bet. It’s all three bets on one ticket, and while it costs more (betting $2 across the board is a $6 bet), you could still get a chunk of money even if that longshot comes in third.</p><h3><strong>Exotics</strong></h3><p><strong>Exacta, Trifecta, Superfecta</strong></p><p>These bets are called vertical bets or predicting the correct order of finish, and they’re an easy way to ease into the betting scene beyond a simple win bet.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>An <strong>exacta</strong> requires picking the first two finishers in order, a <strong>trifecta</strong> requires predicting the first three, and a <strong>superfecta</strong> requires picking the first four horses to cross the finish line.</p><p>These can be bet in multiple ways. Exactas, trifectas and superfectas can be “boxed,” meaning the horses you pick can finish in any order for more money. Boxing a $2 two-horse exacta would cost $4. A $2 trifecta box with three horses would cost $12 (i.e. – betting the 1, 4 and 5 horses and doing a trifecta box means you are betting finishes of 1,4,5; 1,5,4; 4,1,5; 4,5,1; 5,1,4; and 5,4,1 — and each of these combos costs $2 each).</p><p>You can also choose to “key” a horse, meaning if you like Epicenter this weekend, you can place him on top or in the win position and chose several potential horses to finish underneath. This would look something like Epicenter/Messier, Zandon, Taiba/Simplification, Cyberknife, Zozos, Tawny Port, White Abarrio.</p><p>When betting, you would use the horse’s numbers, so it would look like 3/6, 10, 12/13, 19, 18, 15 if you were placing a bet with a teller. This allows you to put the heavy favorite on top, three horses that could finish second, and then a long shot or two in third.</p><p>Of note: Because superfectas are tricky to predict, they can offer big payouts in a race like the Derby ($51,400 in 2019), but they can get expensive. While many racetracks offer superfectas at 10 cents/bet, they are a $1 minimum on Derby day, so choose your horses carefully, so it doesn’t get too expensive. Boxing four horses at $1 will cost you $24.</p><h3><strong>Multi-race bets</strong></h3><p><strong>Double</strong></p><p>This involves picking the winners of two specific races. A fun bet is the Kentucky Oaks-Kentucky Derby double, which requires picking the winners of both races across two days. The payout certainly varies, from $1290.50 in 2019 when Country House won to just $16.80 on a $1 bet in 2018 when favored Justify won the Kentucky Derby and second-choice Monomony Girl won the Oaks.</p><p><strong>Pick 3, Pick 4, Pick 5, Pick 6</strong></p><p>This involves picking the winners of either 3,4,5, or 6 straight races. This can be as simple as putting down $2 and selecting one horse in each leg, but many bettors add horses to increase their chances of winning. For example, if you have a conviction on 2 legs of the Pick 3 but no idea who will win the Derby, you could bet “All” on the Derby leg and hope a longshot wins.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Adding more horses to the bet improves your odds but gets quite expensive, so a suggestion is to pick your spots and “single” horses (picking just one) in races you feel most sure about. Pick 5 and Pick 6 bets are tough to hit, but they can promise six-figure payouts at times. It’s fun to pull a group together and go in on the bet together.</p><h2>Odds, horses, and post positions</h2><table class="in-article table border-transparent-imp in-article-striped in-article-no-column-border-right in-article-no-column-border-left"><tr><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Post Position</span></th><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Horse</span></th><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Odds</span></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p><span>1</span></p></td><td><p><span>Mo Donegal</span></p></td><td><p><span>10-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>2</span></p></td><td><p><span>Happy Jack</span></p></td><td><p><span>30-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>3</span></p></td><td><p><span>Epicenter</span></p></td><td><p><span>7-2</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>4</span></p></td><td><p><span>Summer Is Tomorrow</span></p></td><td><p><span>30-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>5</span></p></td><td><p><span>Smile Happy</span></p></td><td><p><span>20-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>6</span></p></td><td><p><span>Messier</span></p></td><td><p><span>8-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>7</span></p></td><td><p><span>Crown Pride</span></p></td><td><p><span>20-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>8</span></p></td><td><p><span>Charge It</span></p></td><td><p><span>20-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>9</span></p></td><td><p><span>Tiz The Bomb</span></p></td><td><p><span>30-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>10</span></p></td><td><p><span>Zandon</span></p></td><td><p><span>3-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>11</span></p></td><td><p><span>Pioneer Of Medina</span></p></td><td><p><span>30-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>12</span></p></td><td><p><span>Taiba</span></p></td><td><p><span>12-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>13</span></p></td><td><p><span>Simplification</span></p></td><td><p><span>20-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>14</span></p></td><td><p><span>Barber Road</span></p></td><td><p><span>30-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>15</span></p></td><td><p><span>White Abarrio</span></p></td><td><p><span>10-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>16</span></p></td><td><p><span>Cyberknife</span></p></td><td><p><span>20-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>17</span></p></td><td><p><span>Classic Causeway</span></p></td><td><p><span>30-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>18</span></p></td><td><p><span>Tawny Port</span></p></td><td><p><span>30-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>19</span></p></td><td><p><span>Zozos</span></p></td><td><p><span>20-1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>20</span></p></td><td><p><span>Rich Strike</span></p></td><td><p><span>30-1</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>(Photo by Luke Sharrett / Bloomberg via Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57kmtwbnFiZ3xzfJFrZmltX2WDcLfEp6uum5uueqWx0ZuwZpqVqcGqusZmnq6hlJp8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./quincy-isaiah-biography-height-weight-and-everything-you-need-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Quincy Isaiah Biography, Height, Weight, And Everything You Need To Know">&larr;
