But one Alabama radio station was ready to celebrate Nick Saban’s sixth title with the Crimson Tide. Shortly after Clemson’s 44-16 championship win, Birmingham radio station WJOX 94.5 FM aired an incredibly long commercial for Academy Sports + Outdoors about Crimson Tide championship gear case you wanted to know what an alternate reality sounded like:</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=landrum-roberts-agebirtday></span><strong>Landrum Roberts Age|Birtday</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>His exact age and date of birth are still under investigation we will Update when information is available.</p><p>Other Personalities:<strong> Jim Daly</strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=landrum-roberts-family></span><strong>Landrum Roberts Family</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After doing our research, details about her parents are not available and it is also not known if he has any siblings.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=landrum-roberts-body-measurements></span><strong>Landrum Roberts&nbsp; Body Measurements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li><strong>Height</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Weight</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Shoe Size</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Body Shape</strong>: Not Available</li><li><strong>Hair Colour</strong>: Not Available</li></ul><p>“Many Bama fans coming through, getting all their title apparel. What a great win over Clemson for the Crimson Tide. The sixth title in 10 years. Truly amazing. Title number seven for Nick Saban.”The ad was obviously pre-recorded as radio personality Landrum Roberts (the dude talking) appeared to have covered Monday’s game at Levi’s Stadium. He expected a Bama blowout win too.</p><p>While the ad was inadvertently programmed, it definitely didn’t go unnoticed. How could it? The commercial was a minute long.It would have been one thing for the ad to be your typical 20-30 seconds, but the station aired a full 60-second spot for a result that didn’t happen. It just kept going.Just don’t go to Academy Sports + Outdoors in Hoover expecting to find any Alabama title gear. You’ll be disappointed.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=landrum-roberts-salary></span><strong>Landrum Roberts Salary</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>His annual salary is estimated to be between $24,292 and $72,507 or an hourly average wage of between $10.15 and $31.32.
