She was the oldest of ten siblings and grew up in the nearby city of Pico-Rivera. Her father worked as a mechanic, and her mother ran a small business out of their home. Molina was the first in her family to attend college, earning a degree from California State University, Los Angeles, where she later earned a master‚Äôs degree in social work. Molina‚Äôs experiences growing up in a large family and her education in social work would later influence her political and policy work.</p><p>During the 1970s, Molina became involved in the Chicano civil rights movement, advocating for greater representation and resources for Latino communities. Her political career began in 1982 when she was elected to the Los Angeles City Council, becoming the first Latina to hold the position. During her time on the council, Molina advocated for various causes, including affordable housing, gang prevention, and domestic violence prevention. In 1991, Molina became the first Latina to serve in the United States Congress, representing California‚Äôs 31st congressional district. Molina served one term in Congress before stepping down to run for the L.A. County Board of Supervisors in 1994.</p><p>Molina would go on to serve as a member of the L.A. County Board of Supervisors for more than a decade. During this time, she worked on various issues, including healthcare, education, and environmental justice. In 2008, Molina was appointed to the California Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. She served in this position until 2015, after which she continued to advocate for various causes and mentor young people interested in public service. Molina would describe her approach to public service as ‚Äúfeisty,‚Äù saying that she was not afraid to speak her mind or challenge the status quo.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_did_Gloria_Molina_die_What_was_the_cause_of_her_death></span><strong>How did Gloria Molina die?
