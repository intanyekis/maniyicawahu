Before she was a mega Disney star, she actually placed third on The Next <a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a> Project, a singing contest run by Miley herself, who proved she was destined to be a star. Sabrina has also surprised fans with her beautiful voice and music career, releasing four studio albums. But not everything has been easy for her. The lyrics of one of her songs received backlash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Months after <a href=#>Sabrina was torn apart by mostly Olivia Rodrigo's fans for apparently dating Joshua Bassett</a> and releasing her song, Skin, she finally opened up about how that moment really affected her career and her life. The week of its release, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skin debuted at number 48 on the Billboard Hot 100, making it the highest debut on the chart for the week</a>. The song also reached number one in New Zealand and peaked at the top 30 in the United Kingdom. So when Sabrina released Skin, the song was widely popular. Since then fans wonder: What has the star revealed about her boyfriends through her music?</p><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-song-39-skin-39-responds-to-olivia-rodrigo-39-s-39-drivers-license-39>Sabrina Carpenter Song' Skin' Responds to Olivia Rodrigo's 'Drivers License'</h2><p>There are many reasons why Skin is one of Sabrina's most popular songs. One is because fans found it amazing and posted comments like, "Skin is more than just a song. It's a beautiful, emotional experience, a rollercoaster journey, a reminder that there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that you shouldn't let other people destroy you. I'm so proud of Sabrina and all that she is. This is amazing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Fans Think Sabrina Carpenter Dated This 'Riverdale' Star</a></span></p><p>Another fan also wrote, "Honestly, Skin is such an amazing song. Sabrina Carpenter's vocals, along with the lyrics, are so beautiful and poetic. The music video is so perfect and my favorite one of hers. I've been a fan since Girl Meets World, and I'm so proud of her and how she holds herself." The song was also very popular because of the belief that Sabrina had written the song in response to Olivia's Drivers License.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sabrina-carpenter-says-her-39-skin-39-lyrics-are-misinterpreted>Sabrina Carpenter Says Her 'Skin' Lyrics Are Misinterpreted</h2><p>As Olivia dominated the charts, Sabrina was being dragged through the mud. In an October 2021 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>, almost nine months after its release, Sabrina talked about her career after the release of all the songs and their popularity. In the interview, she opened up about how people received the music and how it really messed her up, saying, "That was a song which, unfortunately, was what I was going through, at a time in my life where I couldn't ignore it." Then she added, "When I wrote the song, I don't know if I anticipated it being heard — which is probably why it came from a much more truthful place."</p><p>Sabrina added that the whole experience around the song was overwhelming, partly because she thinks the track was totally misperceived. Then she said it was a complete waste of time because people will never know the truth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Sabrina Carpenter Teases Her Upcoming Song 'Skinny Dipping' By Literally Doing That And Fans Are Loving It</a></span></p><p>Joshua and Sabrina may or may not have dated after the actor seemingly broke up with Olivia. Fans were actually convinced that <a href=#>there was a love triangle going on when Olivia released the song Drivers License</a> in January 2020. Many fans speculated that the song was about their relationship and Joshua moving on with Sabrina. Olivia singing about her ex moving on with a blonde girl broke the internet.</p><h2 id=did-sabrina-carpenter-date-her-39-girl-meets-world-39-co-star-corey-fogelmanis>Did Sabrina Carpenter Date Her 'Girl Meets World' Co-Star Corey Fogelmanis?</h2><p>In 2018 during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seventeen</a> magazine, Sabrina talked about starring on Girl Meets World, releasing two pop albums (Singular: Act I and Singular: Act II), and her relationships with her Girl Meets World co-stars. Especially, Corey Fogelmanis. Fans thought the pair were dating. However, Sabrina denied the rumors on an Instagram post. She wrote, "You're a great friend, and I'm honored to know you and not date you. Thanks for being there for me and not dating me. Love you so much. Platonically."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sabrina also talked about her third album titled Singular. The actress admitted she was going deeper and more intimate with her lyrics in the album, saying, "When I turned 18, [music execs] would say things like, 'People will take you seriously a lot quicker if you just get out there with the mature content.' "But I felt that I shouldn't write about that stuff just because I'm 18; I need to do it if I'm actually going through it—and I was never that kid who was doing the [more mature] personal life stuff. I love love, I love getting in-depth about it, and I experience all the normal 19-year-old feelings, but I wanted to be cautious." Carpenter also revealed anxiety was one of her biggest struggles, but she was working through it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although there have been rumors that Sabrina has dated some celebrities like Griffin Gluck, Casey Cott, Corey Fogelmanis, and Bradley Simpson, <a href=#>the actress doesn't talk much about her love life</a>. For this reason, it isn't easy to know who she has genuinely dated, besides the star of High School Musical: The Musical: The Series, Joshua Bassett, and Good Luck Charlie's actor, Bradley Steven Perry.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's How Sabrina Carpenter Amassed Her Reported $4 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmpqinruiecKaqamdnqmys3nBqLCfqpmau6V5yaiqoa2RYq%2Biv9Keq61lo6S7qL%2BMq6ammZ6ptqR5x6Kqraeirnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./selena-gomez-earned-more-net-worth-acting-music-only-murders-in-the-building.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Has Selena Gomez Earned More Of Her Net Worth From Her Acting Career Or Her Music Career?">&larr;
