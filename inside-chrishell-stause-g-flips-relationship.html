Stause and Oppenheim Group co-founder, Jason Oppenheim began dating last year, with their whirlwind of a romance features on the latest season of Selling Sunset.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Christine Get Fired From 'Selling Sunset' For Exposing How Fake The Show Is?</a></span></p><p>Despite their chemistry, the duo called it quits, but Chrishell didn't waste much time before finding herself in yet another relationship. The soap star turn realtor extraordinaire is currently dating Georgia Claire Flipo, professionally as G Flip, and their romance is certainly been on everyone's minds.</p><h2 id=chrishell-and-g-flip-officially-go-public>Chrishell And G Flip Officially Go Public</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chrishell Stause has not had it easy when it comes to her love life. During her time on Selling Sunset, the soap actress turn reality TV star was married to This Is Us actor, Justin Hartley. The duo called it quits back in November 2019, when Justin reportedly <a href=#>ended his marriage to Chrishell via text</a>. Ouch!</p><p>Luckily for Stause, things have been looking up for the star when it comes to her love life as she ventures into a new relationship with Aussie singer, G Flip. The two first began dating following Chrishell's split from Selling Sunset cast member, Jason Oppenheim.</p><p>G Flip and Chrishell have been quite public regarding their relationship, and have even gone as far as revealing they'd want kids together one day. During a visit to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People's Every Day Podcast</a>, G Flip said, "I definitely see children in my future," they told host, Janine Rubenstein.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Right now, me and Chrishell know where we are in the stages of our lives. And we're very transparent about that," G Flip said. "I feel like it honestly like it changes the world, and it normalizes same-sex relationships...Two people who have the same sex organs can still have children," they stated.</p><h2 id=chrishell-appears-in-g-flip-39-s-newest-music-video>Chrishell Appears In G Flip's Newest Music Video</h2><p>While expanding the family is something the duo is thinking of at the moment, it seems as if Chrishell and G Flip are putting it all out there, literally.</p><p>Stause appeared in G Flip's most recent music video, 'Get Me Outta Here', where the two share some on-screen love — proving that their relationship has evolved quite a lot since revealing their love for one another late last year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Much Is 'Selling Sunset' Star Amanza Smith Worth?</a></span></p><h2 id=jason-oppenheim-says-he-still-loves-chrishell>Jason Oppenheim Says He Still Loves Chrishell</h2><p>Prior to her time with G Flip, Chrishell shocked Selling Sunset viewers when it was revealed that she and Jason Oppenheim were an item.</p><p>The two dated for a little over seven months <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">before calling it quits</a> — which was discussed heavily at the reunion, leading to a lot of emotions.</p><p>However, there is still love there...well, at least for Jason there is. During the season 5 reunion, host Tan France asked Jason about his split from Chrishell, inquiring if he still has feelings for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"That's like asking me if the Earth is flat," Jason responded, making his answer a resounding "yes." The Oppenheim owner then began to get quite emotional, which was a surprise for both the cast and viewers, who rarely see Jason in such a vulnerable position.</p><p>During the reunion, Jason went on to share that his relationship with Chrishell "felt real and deep and loving," and that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he still loves her very much.</a></p><p>"I still love her, obviously, so it has definitely been an extremely difficult process for me," Oppenheim said.</p><p>In an interview with E! Online, Jason went on to say that his relationship with Chrishell, although short-lived, was easily his most serious relationship to date.</p><p>"I've had very few serious relationships and, in many ways, this was the most serious," Jason shared.</p><p>While fans are wondering what might be next for Jason when it comes to his love life, Chrishell is off living her best life with G Flip.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Is Chrishell Stause Using A Fake Name On 'Selling Sunset'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigp6uZmbJur8eroKyglaG5br%2FTmqysnV2ceqe4yKmqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./john-mayer-gets-trolled-in-recent-ig-post-by-katy-perrys-rumored-ex-ryan-phillippe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="John Mayer Gets Trolled In Recent IG Post By Katy Perry's Rumored Ex, Ryan Phillippe">&larr;
