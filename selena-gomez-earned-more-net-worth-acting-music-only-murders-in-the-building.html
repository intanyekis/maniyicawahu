She started acting as a child on Barney & Friends and has since blossomed into a full-blown Hollywood star. Her starring role on Wizards of Waverly Place put her on the map. Once she started appearing in movies like Spring Breakers, Ramona and Beezus, and Monte Carlo, she was unstoppable. She even produced the hit Netflix series 13 Reasons Why in 2017.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Selena Gomez Photo Wearing Same Sweater As Chris Evans Refuels Dating Rumors</a></span></p><p>Gomez decided to take her line of work in a new direction by launching a music career. Little did she know she would perform so well in both industries and her singing career skyrocketed. She has sold 6.7 million albums and 22 million singles worldwide. She even has more than 5 billion U.S. song streams. Her song, "Love You Like a Love Song," and her seductive single “Come & Get It,” were both immediate hits. Before fans knew it, <a href=#>Selena Gomez conquered both the music and acting industry</a> in a single decade. The only real question, therefore, is whether her $75 million dollar net worth comes more from her acting or music career.</p><h2 id=39-wizards-of-waverly-place-39><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>'Wizards Of Waverly Place'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's no secret that miss Selena got her big break on this Disney Channel show back in 2007. <a href=#>Wizards Of Waverly Place starred</a> Selena Gomez alongside David Henrie, Jake T. Austin, Jennifer Stone, Maria Canals-Barrera, and David DeLuise. Gomez played Alex Russo for four seasons and even starred in Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie. Although this wasn't her very first acting gig, it was the one that got her to where she is today.</p><h2 id=39-another-cinderella-story-39><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>'Another Cinderella Story'</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, Selena starred in the sequel to A Cinderella Story, which had starred Hilary Duff and Chad Michael Murray. This second installment showed off Gomez's dancing and singing skills and grossed nearly $300 million worldwide. Gomez recorded three songs for the soundtrack and released one with her band "Tell Me Something I Don't Know." This film was just a glimpse into the solo singing career she was bound to have.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Questions We Still Have After Watching The 'Only Murders In The Building' Ending</a></span></p><h2 id=39-only-murders-in-the-building-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>'Only Murders In The Building'</span></h2><p>Selena Gomez hadn't really done anything big in acting for a few years... until 2021. Selena recently starred in the hit comedy series, Only Murders in the Building, alongside two comedic legends. Martin Short, Steve Martin, and <a href=#>Selena Gomez are all part of this murder mystery series</a> that streams on Hulu. She may have hit a slow patch in her acting career, but if there was a way to make a comeback this was it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Only Murders In The Building has become the "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most-streamed comedy premiere in the history of Hulu’s </a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">original programming</a>," and Gomez deserves a lot of credit for the success of the show, not only because of her large following of devoted fans, but also becase of the acting talent she demonstrates in the series.</p><h2 id=selena-gomez-amp-the-scene><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Selena Gomez & The Scene</span></h2><p>In 2008, Selena began her music career with a group called Selena Gomez & the Scene. The pop band consisted of bassist Joey Clement, drummer Greg Garman, keyboardist Dane Forrest, and guitarist Drew Taubenfeld. Selena Gomez was the lead vocalist and they released three studio albums, seven singles, and nine music videos. As we all know, in 2012, Selena decided to focus solely on her own music career, and she left the band.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-revival-39><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>'Revival'</span></h2><p>Her second solo album, "Revival," came out in 2015 and was her first No. 1 album on the Billboard 200 chart. Popular songs included, "Good for You," featuring ASAP Rocky, "Same Old Love" and "Hands to Myself." This album further distinguished Gomez as a serious solo artist. In 2016, she began her concert tour, titled "Revival Tour," which visited North America, Asia, and Oceania, before it was canceled a few months later<a href=#> due to her diagnosis of lupus</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Steve Martin Defends Selena Gomez After Disney Comments Received Backlash</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=39-rare-39><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>'Rare'</span></h2><p>In 2020, Selena released the album, "Rare," after her on-again, off-again relationship with pop sensation Justin Bieber. The pair famously dated on and off from 2010 to 2018 until they ultimately split for good that year. Her hit song "Lose You to Love Me" really hit home with the fans and <a href=#>was presumably about Bieber</a>.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This song was inspired by many things that have happened in my life since releasing my last album,</a>" the 27-year-old said in a statement. "I want people to feel hope and to know you will come out the other side stronger and a better version of yourself."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=acting-or-singing><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Acting Or Singing?</span></h2><p>Both Selena Gomez's acting and singing career are extremely successful compared to the average person. It's quite literally impossible to weigh the success that came from both outstanding careers. The real question is which she prefers to do. Selena Gomez has made it clear that both singing and acting are a passion of hers. Her first love was acting and singing became the second love of her life.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Madelyn Cline Shows Up Solo Looking Amazing At The AMAs Post Chase Stokes Split</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqSVo65us86mnLNllZa%2Fr7HDZqSoqpViu6bAjLCmq6yYYq6kwMinnmalpai2pHnOp6OyZZ2qv6Wx0axkoqZdqbWmecGuoKWcmaO0cA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jonah-falcon-wiki-wife-height-net-worth-career.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jonah Falcon- Wiki, Wife, Height, Net Worth, Career">&larr;
