They make millions and millions of dollars while being adored by their passionate fanbase. They receive major movie deals and recording contracts and appear on all the top magazines. Many celebs love to spend their money on all the items they’ve dreamed about. They buy lavish mansions, expensive cars, and splurge on all kinds of toys. Many celebs that spend like this end up broke with nothing to show for their hard work. On the other hand, there are many world-famous stars that are very careful with their money and spending habits. Some might call them cheap but they prefer “smart with money.”</p><p>Many famous celebs don’t need to live in a lavish mansion or drive a car that costs more than a house. In fact, many wealthy celebs are just like the rest of us. They want to save their money and spend it wisely. Several of these famous stars have been spotted shopping at thrift stores. Some do it for the savings, some for the vintage clothing, and others do it for both. They’re not looking for the latest piece from a famous runway designer. Instead, they’re searching through bins and racks hunting for a bargain. Here is a look at Bargain Hunters: 15 Wealthy Hollywood Stars That Shop At Thrift Stores.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lorde><b>Lorde</b></h2><p>Lorde had her big breakthrough in 2013 and achieved fame beyond her wildest dreams. However, that won’t stop her from bargain hunting in thrift shops. She has released two immensely-popular albums,&nbsp;Pure Heroine and Melodrama. She tours all over the world as her popularity continues to grow. Regardless, she still prefers&nbsp;to wear previously-owned clothing that she finds at thrift stores. In fact, she wears many of these outfits during her stellar concerts. She said,</p><p><strong>“I got this navy blue vintage suit with gold buttons. It fits me perfectly. I wear it onstage all the time.”</strong></p><p>She went on to say, “It’s my best find by far, and it was $50, which is more than I like to spend at a thrift store.”</p><h2 id=elle-varner><strong>Elle Varner</strong></h2><p>Elle Varner is one of the fastest-rising stars in Hollywood. She has released chart-topping singles, tours the world, and can include former First Lady Michelle Obama in her list of fans. She could live the life of a major celebrity spending her money on designer clothes and shoes. Instead,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>she takes pride in her ability to wear unique clothing that can only be found at thrift shops.</strong></p><p>She released the album Perfectly Imperfect, which featured the hit single, “Only Wanna Give It to You.” Despite all of the fame and fortune that has come her way, she still loves finding a bargain. In fact, she was wearing previously-owned clothes in her first music video. She said, “The jacket I’m wearing in the ‘Only Wanna Give It to You’ (music video) was $4 at Goodwill.”</p><h2 id=ryan-tedder><strong>Ryan Tedder</strong></h2><p>Ryan Tedder is the man behind some of the best recording artists. He’s rarely in the spotlight but that likely helps him stay undercover at thrift stores. Tedder has worked with several big name artists, including Beyoncé, Adele, and Jennifer Lopez. He’s also the lead singer for the band One Republic which is best known for the hit single “Apologize.”</p><p><strong>He has a net worth of $30 million, but that’s not obvious when looking in his closet.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He started singing at the age of 7 and began bargain hunting at 13. In fact, the majority of his closet is made up of clothes he’s had since his teen years. He said, “I’ve thrift-shopped since I was 13 and half of my wardrobe to this day are still the same shirts I had when I was 17, 18.”</p><h2 id=alexa-chung><strong>Alexa Chung</strong></h2><p>Alexa Chung is known for her stellar fashion sense and style. She started her career as a model and worked with all the top brands. She is widely regarded as one of the best-dressed celebs. In fact, she is often at the very top of all the best-dressed lists. She models for Harper’s Bazaar, Elle, and Vogue. She now focuses her time on being a TV host.</p><p><strong>Despite her incredible fashion sense, she actually enjoys finding a bargain at thrift shops.</strong></p><p>She does admit that she loves to buy extravagant dresses but acknowledges that she has a special set of skills when it comes to thrift shopping. Her wardrobe is a mix of designer brands and previously-owned clothing found at the bottom of a bin.</p><h2 id=jada-pinkett-smith><strong>Jada Pinkett-Smith</strong></h2><p>Jada Pinkett-Smith has an estimated net worth of $20 million. She’s married to major movie star Will Smith who is worth roughly $260 million. Their kids, Willow and Jaden, are becoming wealthy stars in their own right. They live in a lavish mansion that is so large it has its very own zip code. Jada has starred in several popular films, such as Menace II Society, Bad Moms, and Girls Trip. She is very wealthy and could probably buy anything she desires. However,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>the Smith family knows when to spend money and when to save it.</strong></p><p>Jada is known for searching through bargain bins looking for the perfect deal. She avoids big brand name stores and is often spotted shopping at thrift stores with daughter Willow in Santa Monica.</p><h2 id=kylie-minogue><b>Kylie Minogue</b></h2><p>Despite being one of Australia’s best-selling artists of all time, Kylie Minogue still enjoys shopping at thrift stores. Nothing is better than finding a bargain—not even selling millions of records. She is best known for the critically and commercially-acclaimed hit single “Can’t Get You Out of My Head.”</p><p><strong>She has an estimated net worth of $75 million but enjoys finding a sweet deal as much as the next person.</strong></p><p>In 2009, she tried to go thrift shopping incognito but she was still recognized in her giant hat and sunglasses. She apparently didn’t want anyone to know she’s a bargain hunter. She was seen purchasing $40 worth of items from a Salvation Army store. In fact, she wore a pair of gold hot pants in the video for “Spinning Around,” which she bought at a thrift shop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=daryl-hannah><b>Daryl Hannah</b></h2><p>Daryl Hannah loves to wear fancy dresses as much as the next girl but thrift shopping is where her heart lies. She has starred in several critically and commercially-acclaimed films, such as&nbsp;Blade Runner, Wall Street, and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & Vol. 2. She’s a major Hollywood star but prefers to do her shopping at thrift stores. She does wear designer clothes from time to time but it’s not important to her.</p><p><strong>She just prefers to thrift shop and much of her wardrobe consists of hand-me-downs.</strong></p><p>She once said, “Everything I’m wearing is my mum’s — I get “new” clothes from other people’s hand-me-downs.” She went on to say, “I still fit into stuff I had when I was 17, and I can find anything I ever want in thrift shops.”</p><h2 id=zac-efron><strong>Zac Efron</strong></h2><p>Despite his gigantic muscles and charming good looks, Zac Efron doesn’t always strut his stuff in designer tuxedos. Efron loves to search through thrift stores for the perfect vintage clothing. Efron first gained fame with his breakout role in Disney’s High School Musical. He has since gone on to become a major movie star with an estimated net worth of $18 million. He does enjoy spending his money but also finds places where he can save them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>He is often spotted at various thrift shops searching through bins and racks of vintage clothing.</strong></p><p>He’s been in the habit of thrift shopping since his teen years. He even went old school for his prom tuxedo.&nbsp;He noted, “I had the brilliant idea of wearing a vintage tuxedo, I was determined to find one so I went to Goodwill.”</p><h2 id=janelle-mon-e><strong>Janelle&nbsp;Monáe</strong></h2><p>Janelle Monáe is a major Hollywood star that is a triple threat. She is a critically-acclaimed actress, a chart-topping recording artist, and a magnificent thrift store shopper. She can truly do it all. Monáe was universally praised for her outstanding roles in Hidden Figures and Moonlight. She also released the albums The ArchAndroid and The Electric Lady.</p><p><strong>She’s quickly becoming a major celebrity but she hasn’t let that interfere with her bargain shopping.</strong></p><p>Monáe loves shopping for a deal and is often seen in her hometown, Atlanta, at the thrift store Poor Little Rich Girl. She’s very proud of her frugal ways that often results in a unique fashion sense that is all her own. She once said, “I like one-of-a-kind pieces. I don’t like everybody walking around in stuff that I have on.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drew-barrymore><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong></h2><p>Drew Barrymore is a member of the legendary Barrymore family. She made her film debut at the age of 7 in the beloved sci-fi classic E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. She went on to become one of the biggest celebs and starred in a number of critically-acclaimed films. She’s had a long and illustrious career with an estimated net worth of $125 million. Just because she’s a multi-millionaire doesn’t mean she lives the life of a wild Hollywood star, although she was out of control as a teen. However,</p><p><strong>she’s always tried to be smart and wise with her spending habits.</strong></p><p>She searches through all the thrift shops and flea markets looking for the best deal. In 2010, she stunned photographers when walking the red carpet in a $25 dress she found at a thrift store.</p><h2 id=macklemore><strong>Macklemore</strong></h2><p>It really should be no surprise that the Grammy Award-winning Macklemore is thrifty and always in search of a deal. He wrote a chart-topping single all about his love of finding bargain secondhand clothes. In 2013, he released the hit single “Thrift Shop,” which tells you all you need to know. He’s also known for releasing the popular albums The Heist and This Unruly Mess I’ve Made. After his big breakthrough with the single “Thrift Shop” most fans assumed his days of bargain hunting were behind him.

If he wanted to, he could afford a bunch of ridiculously expensive brand name clothes and accessories but he opts for a vintage style.</p><h2 id=lara-spencer><strong>Lara Spencer</strong></h2><p>Lara Spencer has made quite the living out of being a frugal star looking for the perfect deals. She parlayed her bargain hunting skills into a lucrative TV series and book deal. Lara is best known as co-host on ABC’s Good Morning America.
