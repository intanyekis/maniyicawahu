There's also a lot of chatter about what happened to Teri Hatcher. Let's take a look.</p><h2 id=teri-s-acting-career>Teri's&nbsp;Acting Career</h2><p>Desperate Housewives&nbsp;is a beloved show and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans love many of the quotes on the show.</a>. Since Susan was such a&nbsp;great character, people are&nbsp;now wondering what happened to Teri Hatcher's acting career.</p><p>NZ Herald&nbsp;reported that as of November 2019,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">didn't seem to be starring in a movie or TV show</a>, based on her IMDb page.</p><p>In 2018, there was a lot of talk&nbsp;that the actress&nbsp;wasn't doing well. Teri Hatcher was upset about that and explained,&nbsp;"On the cover yesterday (Star magazine has) an article that says exactly that — it's totally absurd — that I am broke and homeless and living out of my van.&nbsp;It's categorically false. I am not broke. I have done very well investing my money. I am not homeless and I am not living out of my van."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After she finished her time as Susan on Desperate Housewives, she played the character of Kate Quimby on the TV series Jane By Design. She played Rebecca Tyler in one episode of&nbsp;Funny Or Die Presents...&nbsp;in 2012. She was the voice of Dottie in 2013's&nbsp;Planes&nbsp;and 2014's&nbsp;Planes: Fire And Rescue.</p><p>In recent years, Hatcher hasn't acted very much: from 2016 to 2017, she played Charlotte in the reboot of&nbsp;The Odd Couple, then played Rhea in 8 episodes of&nbsp;Supergirl.</p><p>But there have been no starring roles in a movie or on a TV show, nothing like Susan on&nbsp;Desperate Housewives.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Happened To Ashley Rickards After MTV’s ‘Awkward’ Ended?</a></span></p><h2 id=hatching-change>'Hatching Change'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teri Hatcher began a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube&nbsp;channel called Hatching Change</a>&nbsp;and had a show called "Van Therapy" where she asked people to come into her van and talk to her. This might be where the rumors about her living in a van came from.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly, she explained, "They can be really little subjects or really big subjects, but I feel so lucky that I’m able to connect with these people whom I might otherwise never have come into contact with." She continued that while she might not share a lot of&nbsp;similarities with the people she was talking to, they could find something to bond over: she said, "And the answer might be nothing but I think more often than not there’s something that connects us. We’re much more alike than we think we are.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Vanessa Williams Been Up To Since ‘Ugly Betty’?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=healthy-cooking>Healthy Cooking</h2><p>Teri Hatcher also cooks on her YouTube channel and she told&nbsp;Entertainment Weekly&nbsp;that she likes eating healthy and would love to inspire others to do the same: she said, "I’m trying to provide some fun while trying to convince people to eat less processed food.”</p><p>Hatcher has many cooking videos on her channel: "1 For 1 Meal: One Pan For One Person"&nbsp;has recipes for lamb, salad, salmon, and stuffed peppers.

She explained that she was following a challenge with F45 that lasted eight weeks and between working out and eating anti-inflammatory foods, she was doing great. She "Exercise has become a source of well-being, not a means to look good naked. This is my truth and being in this 55-year-old body actually feels liberating. Here’s the thing. I’ve finally figured out how to be comfortable in my own skin. Maybe not every day but a lot of them.
