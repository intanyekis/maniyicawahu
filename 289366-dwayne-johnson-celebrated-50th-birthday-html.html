His wife and daughters always show support.</p><p class=dh>Dwayne Johnson's childhood was uncommon. By the time he was 13 years old, he had already lived in 13 cities. Johnson's relationship with his father, former professional wrestler Rocky, was far from perfect.</p><p class=dh>Rocky became homeless at 13, and it shaped him. He raised Johnson with tough love, who became a professional wrestler after playing college football. Johnson became part of the WWF (currently known as the WWE) in 1996, and the rest is history.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/960be58609b2447e6e9ee3d3ca812056.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Dwayne Johnson and Lauren Hashian on December 9, 2019, in Hollywood, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>WHO IS DWAYNE JOHNSON'S WIFE, LAUREN HASHIAN?</strong></p><p class=dh>During his early years as a wrestler, Dwayne Johnson got the support of his ex-wife, <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/dwayne-johnsons-screwed-up-first-24783522>Dany Garcia</a>. They married in 1997 and welcomed a daughter before amicably parting ways in 2007.</p><p class=dh>Johnson confessed he made several mistakes during his first marriage and couldn't even identify them. Luckily, Johnson and Garcia have kept such a healthy and respectful relationship that she has been his manager since 2008.</p><p class=dh>In August 2019, Dwayne Johnson married <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/dwayne-johnson-wife-4724231/>Lauren Hashian</a>, the musician raising The Rock's two youngest daughters, in an intimate ceremony in Hawaii.</p><p class=dh>They met on the set of "The Game Plan" in 2006 and began dating one year later. The couple kept most details of their relationship under wraps, only making their red-carpet debut in 2013.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/4edf6e655f78966d5be2727180522974.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Dwayne Johnson and Simone Garcia Johnson on July 10, 2018, in New York City. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MEET DWAYNE JOHNSON'S CHILDREN</strong></p><p class=dh>Johnson might be a 6-foot-5-inch and weighs plus-minus 250 pounds, but he is surrounded by estrogen as his three children <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/movies/dwayne-johnson-and-lauren-hashian-relationship-timeline/>are girls</a>. The eldest is Simone, his only daughter with Dany Garcia. Simone followed in her dad's footsteps and signed a contract with WWE in 2020.</p><p class=dh>With Lauren Hashian, Dwayne Johnson has two daughters, Jasmine and Tiana (born in December 2015 and April 2018, respectively). After both girls were born, Johnson shared his excitement on social media, praising Hashian for delivering like "a true rockstar."</p><h3 class=ih><strong class=bh>He earned about $650,000 per episode of "Ballers."</strong></h3><p class=dh>Although Johnson didn't post anything online about how he celebrated his 50th birthday, his daughters and wife were probably a significant part of it. His fans and friends (including some WWE legends) did share <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://comicbook.com/wwe/news/dwayne-johnson-the-rock-50th-birthday-wwe-superstars/#8>warm birthday messages</a> on social media.</p><p class=dh>"Peacemaker" star <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CdDlJvSuguZ/>John Cena</a> posted a throwback photo of Johnson during his glory days in the WWE, and former wrestler Triple H wished him a happy birthday on Twitter. He <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/TripleH/status/1521180972305240067/>wrote</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Happy Birthday to an athlete, performer, entrepreneur, and a generational entertainer who has continually pushed the boundaries of how we define success."</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>AMONG THE HIGHEST-PAID HOLLYWOOD ACTORS</strong></p><p class=dh>While Johnson's wrestling career made him a star, his life changed after making the successful transition to acting. He has been active in Hollywood since the late 1990s, but his first big box success was 2011's "Fast Five."</p><p class=dh>With over 60 acting credits under his belt, <a class="me a" href=#>Dwayne Johnson</a> is one of the <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dwayne-rock-johnson-growing-net-110001417.html>highest-paid</a> Hollywood actors. He earned about $650,000 per episode of "Ballers," $23.5 million for "Red Notice," and $25 million for "San Andreas."
