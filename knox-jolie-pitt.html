But who exactly is Knox Jolie-Pitt?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Youngest Jolie-Pitt Destined for Fame</h2><p>Knox Jolie-Pitt belongs from the youngest of the clan of the top-tier Hollywood superstar duo Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt. Everyone who even in the slightest knows the word Hollywood knows who Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are, and the famous coupling of Brangelina.</p><p>But who exactly is the young star who has been curtailed off from the public eye? And from where does he belong?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brangelina’s prodigy</h2><p>The children of Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt are destined for royalty, from the youngest to the oldest. Whether it is their illuminated star family or their recent Hollywood screen debuts, no one can deny the inevitable paparazzi magnet and the destined progeny of one of the world’s most famous actor duo.</p><p>Both the actors when they got together received the famous term ‘Brangelina’ which is a combination of the word Brad and Angelina. At the time, the word Brangelina was top trending on social media platforms and was on the lips of every journalist and critic, alike.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Origins of Knox Jolie-Pitt</h2><p>The 12-year-old was born alongside his sister<a href=#> Vivienne</a> and <a href=#>Shiloh</a> and has the most romantic of birth <a href=#>stories</a> there can be. Both received much paparazzi and media attention leading up to their birth. Both the twins received much spotlight when they were born on the French Riviera, which is a beautiful seaside city in the charming Nice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vizaca.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Origins-of-Knox-Jolie-Pitt-683x1024.jpg><p>Knox was born a minute earlier than his sister Vivienne. The date was 12 July 2008 and who would know that they would be their mother’s favorite companions for her chores.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Origin of the names</h2><p>Knox Leon Jolie-Pitt is named after his great grandfather from his paternal side, Hal Knox Hillhouse. The name Leon is derived from his maternal great-grandfather.</p><p>His sister Vivienne’s middle name is Marcheline which is taken from her maternal grandmother, Angelina Jolie’s mother, Marcheline Bertrand.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Fortune for Knox’s baby pictures</h2><p>It is known that paparazzi pay a lot when it peaks their interest, and the children of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie were no exception. Their baby pictures are probably incomparable when it comes to super-priced and such high-profiled celebrity pictures.</p><p>Both the twin’s coverage and their photos just after a month of being born were sold for a huge amount of $15 million USD to magazines Hello! and People. Pictures were jointly published by both magazines, and the proceeds generated from the media-hyped baby photoshoot were then donated to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Privacy prevails</h2><p>13-year-old and growing at a fast pace, Knox Jolie-Pitt along with his sister Vivienne although belong to the best of the best celebrity duo and it can seldom be imagined that their lives would be below the radar of the paparazzi.&nbsp;</p><p>However, even though he is the offspring of the world’s most famous actors, his life along with his twin is private and enviable.</p><p>Since his birth in 2008, his parents have taken utmost care when it has come to their privacy and personal lives. Their lives have been cordoned off from the ever-present lens of the media, and little is known besides what is let out to the public regarding their daily lives.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Home Schooling</h2><p>Even though the recent pandemic opened new domains for the work culture, the A-list clan made the decision long ago for their kids to receive home schooling. But Knox is not the only child who was nominated along with his twin for this mode of learning, all of his siblings were homeschooled, too.</p><p>But as would naturally come to mind that the decision to homeschool would be due to privacy concerns or safety, Angelina Jolie has publicly admitted that the home-schooling decision for all of her children from the eldest to the youngest have originated somewhat from the desire to provide for her family an unbiased, well-managed education.</p><p>All of the children of Brangelina are home-tutored in a variety of subjects which span the world, like foreign languages. They are also taught sports and are very fond of soccer and skateboarding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Knox Jolie-Pitt’s philanthropic inheritance</h2><p>As the famous saying goes, Knox and his sister have taken from their mother the will to act for humanitarian causes and philanthropic ventures. For their mother, the need for the betterment of humanity has grown as important as her acting career, and so has apparently for Knox Jolie-Pitt.</p><p>This cause was exemplary when Knox along with his family was seen in their neighborhood park selling dog organic treats and were witnessed by Angelina Jolie’s fellow actress Sarah Ramos. They were selling organic treats to raise and gather funds for the local Los Angeles animal organization for dog rescue, Hope for Paws.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Following their parents</h2><p>Knox was seen and has spent much of his childhood travelling around the world with his parents to their various abodes and residences and movie sets and has often travelled to the ex-couple’s Chateau Miraval in Correns, France. Although Knox and his sister have spent much of their childhood in the chateau, the recent divorce of their parents have made their LA home their visitation place.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Angelina Jolie’s shopping companion</h3><p>Knox has spent much time with her mother whenever she has gone out shopping. Jolie has been seen much of the time being accompanied by both her twins Knox and Vivienne whenever she used to go shopping or picking up other supplies such as flowers, art, or other groceries.</p><p>In this way, she makes sure she spends one on one time with her children, as is not normally expected of such a busy parent. Knox is also seen making stops at pet stores whenever they are in their hometown, and even bringing their pets out of the house when doing so.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Celebrating birthdays</h3><p>Knox has also experienced normal upbringing, or the closest to it, when he went with her mother to Disneyland to celebrate his birthday, along with his sister. Both the twins held their mother’s hand, and they went through the park as any other family goes out to celebrate or to get entertained from its various rides.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stepping foot into Hollywood</h2><p>As is apparent from various interviews from both the parents, they do not force their children to follow their steps when it comes to the big screen. But still, Knox has appeared in major blockbuster films as cameos or other roles.</p><p>Knox has given his voice and acted as a voice actor for the character Ku Ku in Kung Fu Panda 3. The film is the third part in the trilogy of the famous blockbuster animated film. His sister has appeared as Princess Aurora on screen alongside with her mother in Maleficent.</p><p>Knox and his siblings have profited a great deal from their mother’s celebrity star status. They have attended premieres, red carpet events and more. Knox has also attended events for Dumbo and Maleficent: Mistress of Evil. Knox along with his sister also traveled to London to support and attend his mother when the film premiered, globally.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Knox as a person</h2><p>Knox could be seen standing with his family on red carpet events confidently and with a smile on his face. From a very young age, Knox would confront the paparazzi with a smile and wave at them whenever his family and he would be bombarded with the media, whether it would be at airports or events. His sister, Vivienne would look shy and would stay close to her mother, as opposed to his brother.</p><p>The fraternal twins were always commented as resembling one another, as would be natural when they were young. Both had blonde locks and were of similar height in their pre-teens. However, as they grew up, both have developed their own unique looks, their hair has changed in color, and have developed distinct faces.</p><p>Whenever Knox was photographed, he would look casual but smart and stylish. He would seldomly be pictured in a black jacket and grey pants and would look confident as ever.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Custody of Knox and siblings after his parent’s divorce</h2><p>A judge granted Brad Pitt joint custody of his children with Angelina Jolie, and the actress has appealed the said judge’s grant.&nbsp;</p><p>“The burden for someone who is appealing the finding of the trial judge is really high because the appellate courts don’t want to sit as trial judges, and to determine facts,” said Michael Stutman, celebrity divorce attorney and a founding partner at Stutman, Stutman Lichtenstein & Felder explained to HollywoodLife.</p><p>Angelina Jolie and her former husband Brad Pitt have both been involved in a court custody dispute over their six children, which also involves Knox.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC3zaivZqKfobamec%2Biq61n</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jaquae-wiki-bio-real-name-net-worth-girlfriend.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jaquae Wiki, Bio, Real Name, Girlfriend, Net Worth, Age, Height, Family">&larr;
